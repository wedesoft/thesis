	abstract={Semi-autonomous and fully autonomous assembly and manipulation of micro-objects is a complex process. As part of the MINIMAN micro-robot project, a vision subsystem is required which can recognise and track objects both under an optical microscope and within a scanning electron microscope. This subsystem is required as part of a more complex system for assembling and manipulating micro-objects. The two different operating environments provide many challenges when building a generic vision system due to the vast differences in the quality of the images. The paper provides a detailed description of this new vision system, together with a discussion and analysis of its flexibility and extensibility. Results of the system's ability to recognise rigid objects robust to camera noise and object occlusions are given, and the adaptability of the system to recognising biological objects is discussed. Finally, an overview is provided of the communication strategy between the vision subsystem and the micro-robot control system},

	abstract={MINIMAN is a European Union sponsored ESPIRIT basic research project which combines the expertise of six leading European academic institutions and two industrial companies. The three-year project (which started at the end of 1998) seeks to explore the possibility of using microrobots in real-world applications. Here the term microrobotics refers to the ability to manipulate and/or assemble objects that are micron-sized or larger. The robot itself is centimetres in size with a piezo-actuated drive and manipulation system providing the small and precise motion required. The complete system is controlled by an innovative vision system, with the vision sensor (camera) being mounted remotely from the robot. This vision subsystem must recognise, track and provide feedback position information regarding the discrete small objects that form a miniature assembly. Consequently the objects are magnified and the assembly task is performed under either an optical microscope or a scanning electron microscope},

	abstract={In the fields of micro-positioning, micro-manipulation and micro-machining, the required motion precision is continuously increasing. The demand also increases for high dynamic performances (large bandwidth, high closed loop stiffness, etc.). In many cases an inappropriate mechanical structure prevents to achieve these objectives. The use of flexure mechanisms and parallel kinematics allows to reach them. Thanks to these choices, mechanical structures are light-weighted and free of backlash, wear, and stick-slip. This paper presents through an example, the design procedure and the control of a flexure-based robot. The example used is a three degrees of freedom (dof) parallel robot (X, Y, Z) that is a transposition in a flexure mechanism of the Delta robot kinematics.},

	abstract={A microfabricated, three-degree-of-freedom, passive, closed-chain, planar mechanism with the potential for low-torque precision positioning applications is presented. A parallel-link mechanism design is selected rather than a serial-link implementation, since parallel-link mechanisms can operate with stationary actuators and are more rigid than their serial counterparts. Polysilicon surface micromachining is used to fabricate a mechanism which has a total area of 0.13 mm0RW1S34RfeSDcfkexd09rT321RW1S34RfeSDcfkexd09rT3 and a workspace of approximately 0.01 mm0RW1S34RfeSDcfkexd09rT321RW1S34RfeSDcfkexd09rT3. The fabrication process for the mechanism is described, identifying the effect on device performance of constraints imposed by the microfabrication; most notably joint clearances, component nonplanarity, and residual-stress-induced linkage deformations. The requisite formulations for the kinematics and dynamics of the device are presented which, in conjunction with the documented measurements of friction on structures of similar geometry and material, indicate that the dominant torque loads are due to friction.},

	abstract={We present a novel approach to measuring similarity between shapes and exploit it for object recognition. In our framework, the measurement of similarity is preceded by 1) solving for correspondences between points on the two shapes, 2) using the correspondences to estimate an aligning transform. In order to solve the correspondence problem, we attach a descriptor, the shape context, to each point. The shape context at a reference point captures the distribution of the remaining points relative to it, thus offering a globally discriminative characterization. Corresponding points on two similar shapes will have similar shape contexts, enabling us to solve for correspondences as an optimal assignment problem. Given the point correspondences, we estimate the transformation that best aligns the two shapes; regularized thin-plate splines provide a flexible class of transformation maps for this purpose. The dissimilarity between the two shapes is computed as a sum of matching errors between corresponding points, together with a term measuring the magnitude of the aligning transform. We treat recognition in a nearest-neighbor classification framework as the problem of finding the stored prototype shape that is maximally similar to that in the image. Results are presented for silhouettes, trademarks, handwritten digits, and the COIL data set.},

The blur kernel is adjusted in the regions where occlusion is present, particularly at the regions of discontinuities in the scene.

	abstract={This paper proposes a joint feature-based model indexing and geometric  constraint based alignment pipeline for efficient and accurate  recognition of 3D objects from a large model database. Traditional  approaches either first prune the model database using indexing without  geometric alignment or directly perform recognition based alignment.  The indexing based pruning methods without geometric constraints can  miss the correct models under imperfections such as noise, clutter and  obscurations. Alignment based verification methods have to linearly  verify each model in the database and hence do not scale up. The  proposed techniques use spin images as semi-local shape descriptors and  locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) to index into a joint spin image  database for all the models. The indexed models represented in the  pruned set are further pruned using progressively complex geometric  constraints. A simple geometric configuration of multiple spin images,  for instance a doublet, is first used to check for geometric  consistency. Subsequently, full Euclidean geometric constraints are  applied using RANSAC-based techniques on the pruned spin images and the  models to verify specific object identity. As a result, the combined  indexing and geometric alignment based pipeline is able to focus on  matching the most promising models, and generate far less pose  hypotheses while maintaining the same level of performance as the  sequential alignment based recognition. Furthermore, compared to  geometric indexing techniques like geometric hashing, the construction  time and storage complexity for the proposed technique remains linear  in the number of features rather than higher order polynomial.  Experiments on a 56 3D model database show promising results},

	abstract={Cartridge cases are important forensic specimen for the identification of weapons. The illumination conditions in the area of the firing pin marks and the breech face marks are very different and have to be treated separately to achieve an appropriate image quality for a visual inspection. Furthermore, not only the comparison but also the detection of the different and independent forensic marks should be automated. Both problems lead to the task of segmenting the different parts of the cartridge case bottom. In this paper, two automated approaches for the segmentation of cartridge cases are investigated and compared. The aim of the segmentation is the detection of the cartridge case border, the primer, the firing pin mark and additionally the letters around the primer. The first approach uses images obtained under systematically varied illumination conditions. After a preprocessing step a circle detection is applied to find the circular structures. The analysis of illumination series combined with a connected components labeling method detect the letters. In a second approach, the depth-from-focus method is used to obtain 21/2D-data. This data is segmented applying a plane estimation technique. This results directly in the detection of the letters. Afterwards a circle detection algorithm identifies the parameters of the circular structures. With the introduced methods it is possible to optimize the illumination in order to realize a higher contrast of both the striation marks on the cartridge case surface and of the indentation of the firing pin independently. The improved image quality helps the examiner in identifying weapons and will help to improve the automated comparison strategies. &copy; 2005 SPIE and IS and T.},

The operations of the robot manipulator take place under a microscope equipped with a CCD-camera. A major drawback of this system is its lack of depth information. For this reason, the sensor system has been enhanced by a line laser, using laser triangulation. The set-up of the modified sensor system is described.

	abstract={We propose a novel approach to improve the distinctiveness of local image features without significantly affecting their robustness with respect to image deformations. Local image features have proven to be successful in computer vision tasks involving partial occlusion, background noise, and various types of image deformations. However, the relatively high number of outliers that have to be rejected from the correspondences set, formed during the search for similar features, still plagues this approach. The task of rejecting outliers is usually based on estimating the global spatial transform suffered by the features in the correspondences set. This presents two problems: i) it cannot properly deal with non-rigid objects, and ii) it is sensitive to a high number of outliers. Here, we address these problems by combining typical local features [2, 7] with shape context [1]. A performance evaluation shows that this new semi-local feature generally provides higher distinctiveness and robustness to image deformations, thus potentially increasing the inlier/ outlier ratio in the correspondences set. Also, we show that in wide baseline stereo matching, and non-rigid motion applications, the use of the novel semi-local feature not only provides robustness to non-rigid deformations, but also produces a higher inlier/outlier ratio than the standard Hough clustering of the global spatial transform of parameters.},

	abstract={Much of business XML data has accompanying XSD specifications. In many scenarios, "shredding" such XML data into a relational storage is a popular paradigm. Optimizing evaluation of XPath queries over such XML data requires paying careful attention to both the logical and physical designs of the relational database where XML data is shredded. None of the existing solutions has taken into account physical design of the generated relational database. In this paper, we study the interplay of logical and physical design and conclude that 1) solving them independently leads to suboptimal performance and 2) there is substantial overlap between logical and physical designs: some well-known logical design transformations generate the same mappings as physical design. Furthermore, existing search algorithms are inefficient to search the extremely large space of logical and physical design combinations. We propose a search algorithm that carefully avoids searching duplicated mappings and utilizes the workload information to further prune the search space. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our approach. &copy; 2005 IEEE.},

	abstract={This paper proposes a wheel-assembly automation system, which assembles a wheel into a hub of a vehicle hung to a moving hanger in a car manufacturing line. A macro-micro manipulator control strategy is introduced to increase the system bandwidth and tracking accuracy to ensure insertion tolerance. A camera is equipped at the newly designed wheel gripper, which is attached at the center of the end-effector of the macro-micro manipulator and is used to measure position error of the hub of the vehicle in real time. The redundancy problem in the macro-micro manipulator is solved without complicated calculation by assigning proper functions to each part so that the macro part tracks the velocity error while the micro part regulates the fine position error. Experimental results indicate that tracking error satisfies the insertion tolerance of assembly (&plusmn; 1mm), and thus it is verified that the proposed system can be applied to the wheel assembly task on a moving hanger in the manufacturing line.},

	abstract={An image-based range sensing technique is presented. The technique is originally considered for highway collision avoidance applications but its generality makes it suitable for application in robotics, manufacturing and metrology as well. It relies on depth from focus but, unlike conventional techniques, it extracts range with a single unmodulated Scheimpflug camera in continuous time. The range extraction algorithm is memoryless and simple enough to be implemented on the same chip with photosensors. The technique deploys a sensor plane that is tilted at a non-orthogonal angle with respect to the optical axis of the lens, and the optical axis intersects the sensor plane at the focal point. This optical arrangement creates a focusable object plane in an orientation parallel to the optical axis, and thus, enables range sensing along the same axis. The paper elaborates on the details of focus sensing on the tilted sensor plane, describes the CMOS sensor/processor chip designed and prototyped for this application, and presents experimental results.},

Analytical expressions are derived in the paper for the variance of the pixel values of the object with a uniform background and the variation of these values with respect to the distance of the object from the surface is studied.

Our scheme improves the running time of the earlier algorithm for the case of the l0RW1S34RfeSDcfkexd09rT421RW1S34RfeSDcfkexd09rT4 norm. It also yields the first known provably efficient approximate NN algorithm for the case p less than or equal 1. We also show that the algorithm finds the exact near neigbhor in O(log n) time for data satisfying certain "bounded growth" condition. Unlike earlier schemes, our LSH scheme works directly on points in the Euclidean space without embeddings. Consequently, the resulting query time bound is free of large factors and is simple and easy to implement. Our experiments (on synthetic data sets) show that the our data structure is up to 40 times faster than kd-tree.},

	abstract={Most SQL-based XML vendor support is through interoperation and not integration. One reason for this is that XML is inherently hierarchical and SQL is supposedly not. This paper demonstrates how ANSI SQL along with its relational Cartesian product model can naturally perform complete and flexible hierarchical query processing. With this ANSI SQL inherent hierarchical processing capability, native XML data can be fully and seamlessly integrated into SQL processing and operated on at a full hierarchical level. This paper describes the basic stages involved in this hierarchical SQL processing: hierarchical data modeling, hierarchical working set creation, and hierarchical Cartesian product processing. These processes enable a complete relational, XML, and legacy data integration which maintains ANSI SQL compatibility even while performing the most complex multi-leg hierarchical processing, and includes the dynamic, direct, and controlled hierarchical joining of hierarchical structures. Also covered are ANSI SQL hierarchical support features: hierarchical SQL views, hierarchical data filtering, and hierarchical optimization. These make standard SQL a well rounded and complete hierarchical processor. With this full hierarchical level of processing established, it is shown how the relational Cartesian product engine can be seamlessly replaced with a hierarchical engine, greatly increasing processing and memory utilization, and enabling advanced XML hierarchical data capabilities},

	abstract={Today several tasks in applications ranging from biology and medicine to microsystems technology demand for high-precision handling techniques. Transport and manipulation of biological cells or assembly of micromechanical parts are important applications for microrobots. A lot of these tasks have to be carried out by humans, but the manual capabilities are restricted to certain tolerances. So manual operation imposes severe restrictions on high quality production because of drastically miniaturised mechanical systems. In the last five years, researchers have developed new micromanipulation systems for applications in industry, biology or medicine. All of them work as telemanipulation systems and the robot, with miniaturised end effectors, is directly operated by the user. The aim of this work-in-progress manuscript is to present the state of our work in the micromanipulation control of a micro gripper. Due to the high resolution restrictions, this micro gripper is based in piezoceramic material and the control system is performed using fuzzy logic techniques},

Monolithic microsystems are built by numerous fabrication steps on one substrate, each step adding a new layer or structuring an existing layer of the microsystem. Monolithic microsystems require almost no assembly besides their integration into a macro-system. Hybrid microsystems, on the other hand, are manufactured by a much broader range of micro-techniques, because parts are assembled to form the final microsystem after their manufacturing. Hybrid microsystems demand for micro-assembly techniques which might become very complex, depending on the complexity of the system.

A new concept of a flexible robot-based microassembly desktop station and two prototypes of piezoelectric microassembly robots, MINIMAN and PROHAM, have previously been developed. In this paper, the motion control approach of these robots is discussed. This control approach is based on the geometric description of the robot platform and aims at following the optimal motion trajectory to minimize the operation time and to keep the robot end effector under microscope supervision. Besides excellent abilities both robots have some disadvantages such as the relatively high drive voltage of the piezoactuators or the instability of grasp-and-hold operations. For this reason, several new piezoelectric microrobots that employ different locomotion and object handling principles have lately been developed. The design and functions of these microrobots are shown},

	abstract={A wide range of microcomponents can today be produced using various microfabrication techniques. The assembly of complex microsystems consisting of several single components (i.e. hybrid microsystems) is, however, a difficult task that is seen to be a real challenge for the robotic research community. It is necessary to conceive flexible, highly precise and fast microassembly methods. In the paper, the development of a microrobot-based microassembly station is presented. Mobile piezoelectric microrobots with dimensions of some cm0RW1S34RfeSDcfkexd09rT331RW1S34RfeSDcfkexd09rT3 and with at least 5 DOF can perform various manipulations either under a light microscope or within the vacuum chamber of a scanning electron microscope. The components of the station developed and its control system are described. The latter comprises a vision-based sensor system for automatic robot control, user interfaces, a re-configurable parallel computer array and an assembly planning system. Specific problems that occur when using microrobots in an SEM and our research activities on the development of force microsensors integrated into the microrobots' grippers are described as well},

	abstract={The development of new types of miniaturized and microrobots with human-like capabilities play an important role in different application tasks. One of the main problem of present-day research is, for example, to assemble a whole microsystem from different microcomponents. This paper presents an automated micromanipulation desktop station including a piezoelectrically driven microrobot placed on the highly-precise x-y stage of a light microscope, a CCD-camera as a local sensor subsystem, a laser sensor unit as a global sensor subsystem, and a Pentium PC equipped additionally with an optical grabber. The microrobot has three piezoelectrically driven legs and two autonomous manipulators as endeffectors; it can perform highly-precise manipulations (with an accuracy of up to 10 nm) and a nondestructive transport (at a speed of several mm/s) of very small objects under a microscope. To perform manipulations automatically, a control system, including a task planning level and a real-time execution level, is being developed.},

	abstract={There is an increasing interest in performing assembly of microsystems (i.e. non-destructive transportation, precise manipulation, and exact positioning of microcomponents) by flexible microrobots. A microrobot-based microassembly desktop station is being developed at the University of Karlsruhe. Several prototypes of piezoelectric driven microrobots and a design of the flexible microassembly desktop station were already presented at the last years' SPIE-meetings. In this paper, some implementation results of the station's planning and control system are presented. On the planning level, a common microassembly model for a computer-aided assembly planning is suggested - which is based on geometric reasoning - and its components are discussed in detail. The feasibility criteria for the generation of feasible assembly sequences and the optimization criteria for selecting the optimal assembly plan are described. For stations employing several microrobots, a method for decomposition of an assembly plan is suggested. Since the station's microrobots are rather complicated systems, it is very hard to find a useful robot model for the control purposes. For this reason, control methods to be used for positioning of a microrobot, which do not require an exact system model and which allow a reasonable compromise between the real-time processing and the exactness. An intelligent neural controller for positioning a microrobot has been developed.},

According to previous study, the basic principle of Bayesian phase-model background subtraction is that the optimum (rms error minimizing strategy) Fourier phases of the noise can be obtained provided the amplitudes of the noise is given, while the noise amplitude can often be estimated from the image itself. A summary of the implementation of noise removal is presented. A vector pattern recognition mapping procedure is applied in order to see the improvement quantitatively.},

	abstract={A new paradigm, Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC), for fitting a model to experimental data is introduced. RANSAC is capable of interpreting/smoothing data containing a significant percentage of gross errors, and is thus ideally suited for applications in automated image analysis where interpretation is based on the data provided by error-prone feature detectors. The authors describe the application of RANSAC to the Location Determination Problem (LDP): given an image depicting a set of landmarks with known locations, determine that point in space from which the image was obtained. In response to a RANSAC requirement, new results are derived on the minimum number of landmarks needed to obtain a solution, and algorithms are presented for computing these minimum-landmark solutions in closed form. These results provide the basis for an automatic system that can solve the LDP under difficult viewing and analysis conditions. Implementation details and computational examples are also presented},

	abstract={In the submillimetric objects manipulations, the adhesion (capillary force, pull-off force and Van-der-Waals force) and the electrostatic forces affect the behavior of the micro-objects. These forces decrease significantly when the micro-objects are submerged in a liquid medium. So a microassembly task is easier to perform in a submerged medium than in air. Consequently, the study of the micro-objects assembly automation in liquid mediums is a promising topic. This article introduces a review of the major differences between dry and submerged micromanipulation. The influences of the medium on electrostatic forces, pull-off force and hydrodynamic forces are presented. Adhesion perturbations are significally reduced in liquid and hydrodynamic forces are advantageous to limit the maximal micro-objects velocity. Some comparative experimental micromanipulations are described and prove the interest of the liquid medium. &copy; 2005 IEEE.},

The robot learns about size, position, and topological relations between objects, and produces a map of the room based on knowledge learned through communication with the human.

This system combines multiple sources of information and model matching to detect and track a human hand so that the user can point toward an object of interest and guide the robot to either go near it or to locate that object's position in the room.

Considering the above characteristics, an adaptive min-distance algorithm is proposed in this paper, which is available to segment the suspected cell and nucleus from the complex background in the microscopic image of cells fallen into peritoneal effusion. 15 features of the cancer cell and calculating formulas are presented respectively. These features are employed to construct a backpropagation neural network classifier which classifies and recognizes the cancer cells fallen into peritoneal effusion.

	abstract={This paper presents the design of a selective-actuation flexure parallel mechanism that could provide three de-coupled micro-motions along the X-, Y- and Z-axes. This mechanism could be used as an ultra-precision positioning system. The modeling of this flexure parallel mechanism is then established based on a pseudo-rigid-body model with consideration of deformation of the flexure member. The factor of deformation allowed the formulation of accurate kinematics analysis of the flexure mechanism. Via this modeling, dimension and free shape of the mechanism are determined based on the criteria of isotropic resolution transmission scale. An experiment was set up to verify the modeling and the design. The experiment shows the advantage of the proposed model versus the model currently used. The similarity of the resolutions obtained from the experiment and predicted by the optimal design shows the validity of the resolution evaluation and the optimal design},

	abstract={Studying the distribution of dislocations in metal crystalline structures has been an important subject in metallurgic science for many years. The authors describe a computer vision based process which automatically extracts dislocations from one type of electron microscopic images which contain such dislocations. In these microscopic images, dislocations appear as dark and triangularly shaped regions. However, some of them are lumped together and form regions of complex shapes. In the suggested process the first step is to extract the boundaries of all the dark regions. The next is to trace along the extracted boundaries to detect possible corners and edges of the dislocations. The last step is to determine the existence of the dislocations and their locations by detecting properly spaced and oriented corners and edges. Experiments have shown that this process is very effective. The approach is comprehensive and deals with many important issues in image processing and pattern recognition},

	abstract={In this paper, we propose a freeze tweezer using the freezing force of a small volume of nucleotide ice to manipulate mini/micro objects in an aqueous state. Several prototypes of such a device based on the Joule-Thompson throttling effect have been fabricated and there have been preliminary demonstrations of their applicability in manipulating a wide variety of objects. By regulating the freezing conditions of the cooler, an ice ball can be formed between the tweezer tip and the object it contacts and then the object can be picked up. This freezing force is strong enough to manipulate objects with any shape, electric charge, light or heavy, biological or non-living, on the condition that the contact area can be frozen. Successful manipulation of a series of specific objects presented in this paper indicates that it would be much easier for the freeze tweezer to handle objects with smaller size. Therefore, further nanoscale freeze tweezers following the same idea as above can be put forward; this is expected to have exciting applications in micro/nano engineering field. Furthermore, theoretical analysis and experiments have been performed to quantify the response time of the freeze tweezer and the mechanical force generated on the tweezer tip. This study has also raised quite a few new fundamental issues related to the fabrication and practices of the freeze tweezer},

The accumulation of these parameters for many points on the surface of the object results in an image at each oriented point. These images, localized descriptions of the global shape of the object, are invariant to rigid transformations. Through correlation of images, point correspondences between a model and scene data are established and then grouped using geometric consistency.

The two main features of this technique are that it uses a binary linear programming approach to set up and solve the correspondence problem, and that it uses constraints based on the physics of SEM image formation. Binary linear programming is a powerful tool with which to tackle constrained optimization problems, especially in the cases that involve matching between one data set and another. The authors also analyze the process of SEM image formation, and present constraints that are useful in solving the stereo correspondence problem. This technique has been solved on many images.

	abstract={The goal of this paper is to provide a "self-adaptive" system for real-time range acquisition. Reconstructions are based on a single frame structured light illumination. Instead of using generic, static coding that is supposed to work under all circumstances, system adaptation is proposed. This occurs on-the-fly and renders the system more robust against instant scene variability and creates suitable patterns at startup. A continuous trade-off between speed and quality is made. A weighted combination of different coding cues - based upon pattern color, geometry, and tracking - yields a robust way to solve the correspondence problem. The individual coding cues are automatically adapted within a considered family of patterns. The weights to combine them are based on the average consistency with the result within a small time-window. The integration itself is done by reformulating the problem as a graph cut. Also, the camera-projector configuration is taken into account for generating the projection patterns. The correctness of the range maps is not guaranteed, but an estimation of the uncertainty is provided for each part of the reconstruction. Our prototype is implemented using unmodified consumer hardware only and, therefore, is cheap. Frame rates vary between 10 and 25 fps, dependent on scene complexity. &copy; 2006 IEEE.},

	abstract={Special micromanipulators are needed to manipulate very small objects. Most micromanipulators are specialized to perform a task they are designed for, but are too inflexible to adapt to other problems. Therefore, flexible newly developed mobile microrobots are presented with precision in the sub-micrometer range while offering a macroscopic workspace. The main parts of each mobile microrobot, the mobile platform, the manipulator and end effectors, are explained in detail, with some experimental data given. The new driving principle of the mobile platform allows high resolution, low energy consumption, which makes an on-board power supply feasible and a maximum velocity of several mm/s. Useful human interfaces are needed for a successful teleoperation. The most important interface next to the vision feedback is a haptic interface. The paper presents a newly developed haptic interface for a micromanipulation station. The mechanical design and the design of the control system of the haptic interface are discussed in details. The control architecture of the micromanipulation station and the integration of the haptic device into the micromanipulation station are presented},

In this paper the outline of this system is firstly explained and the performance of this system is reported in detail. However, since some defects appear at the top surface of the mold cannot be detected even with a set of this 2D inspection procedure, new 3-dimensional inspection of the flatness of the mold top surface was introduced. Depth from Focus Method was implemented in order to enforce this system to cope with 3-dimensional defects. An image processing method for evaluating the flatness of the face of the device is now developed by analyzing this 3D image.

Although the MWCNTs exhibited a high flexibility, the deformation of the MWCNTs above the elastic limit led to structural defects, which resulted in a local plastic deformation.

Each of these regions can be thought of as a texture element having a characteristic elliptic shape and a distinctive appearance pattern. This pattern is captured in an affine-invariant fashion via a process of shape normalization followed by the computation of two novel descriptors, the spin image and the RIFT descriptor. When affine invariance is not required, the original elliptical shape serves as an additional discriminative feature for texture recognition.

	abstract={This paper introduces a shape descriptor, the soft shape context, motivated by the shape context method. Unlike the original shape context method, where each image point was hard assigned into a single histogram bin, we instead allow each image point to contribute to multiple bins, hence more robust to distortions. The soft shape context can easily be integrated into the iterative closest point (ICP) method as an auxiliary feature vector, enriching the representation of an image point from spatial information only, to spatial and shape information. This yields a registration method more robust than the original ICP method. The method is general for 2D shapes. It does not calculate derivatives, hence being able to handle shapes with junctions and discontinuities. We present experimental results to demonstrate the robustness compared with the standard ICP method. &copy; 2004 IEEE.},

	abstract={Kinematic and dynamic modelling of a 3-DOF planar parallel manipulator is presented in this paper. An equilateral triangle forms the output stage of the mechanism, and three driving structures, connected via three links, provide stroke magnification to the output stage. Aiming at achieving micromotions, this manipulator is developed using compliant material. In order to reduce assembly errors, a monolithic structure is adopted in this design. Hence, the joints in this mechanism are all flexural hinges. Since the masses and moments of inertia can be neglected in this lightweight micromanipulator, and the joint resistances are greatly increased owing to the flexure of the joints, new problems arise in the design and modelling of such a mechanism. The results presented in this paper will provide useful information for the design and applications of parallel, compliant micromanipulators},

	abstract={This paper presents a method for extracting distinctive invariant features from images that can be used to perform reliable matching between different views of an object or scene. The features are invariant to image scale and rotation, and are shown to provide robust matching across a substantial range of affine distortion, change in 3D viewpoint, addition of noise, and change in illumination. The features are highly distinctive, in the sense that a single feature can be correctly matched with high probability against a large database of features from many images. This paper also describes an approach to using these features for object recognition. The recognition proceeds by matching individual features to a database of features from known objects using a fast nearest-neighbor algorithm, followed by a Hough transform to identify clusters belonging to a single object, and finally performing verification through least-squares solution for consistent pose parameters. This approach to recognition can robustly identify objects among clutter and occlusion while achieving near real-time performance},

	abstract={An object recognition system has been developed that uses a new class of local image features. The features are invariant to image scaling, translation, and rotation, and partially invariant to illumination changes and affine or 3D projection. These features share similar properties with neurons in inferior temporal cortex that are used for object recognition in primate vision. Features are efficiently detected through a staged filtering approach that identifies stable points in scale space. Image keys are created that allow for local geometric deformations by representing blurred image gradients in multiple orientation planes and at multiple scales. The keys are used as input to a nearest neighbor indexing method that identifies candidate object matches. Final verification of each match is achieved by finding a low residual least squares solution for the unknown model parameters. Experimental results show that robust object recognition can be achieved in cluttered partially occluded images with a computation time of under 2 seconds},

The microassembly has its specifics caused by the tiny dimensions of the robots, high accuracy and complicated vision and control systems required. This paper presents a concept of an intelligent microassembly planning system. This system has been implemented in a micromanipulation station with mobile piezoelectric microrobots, which has been developed at the Institute for Process Control and Robotics (IPR) at the University of Karlsruhe. This research considers the assembly system as a complex system and represents a microassembly environment for the microassembly station. The information flow, interacting and functioning of separate parts of the micromanipulation station are determined and the integration of the assembly subsystem into the station are presented. The principal approaches for each part of the system are given.},

	abstract={Automatic registration of range images is a fundamental problem in 3D modeling of free-from objects. Various feature matching algorithms have been proposed for this purpose. However, these algorithms suffer from various limitations mainly related to their applicability, efficiency, robustness to resolution, and the discriminating capability of the used feature representation. We present a novel feature matching algorithm for automatic pairwise registration of range images which overcomes these limitations. Our algorithm uses a novel tensor representation which represents semi-local 3D surface patches of a range image by third order tensors. Multiple tensors are used to represent each range image. Tensors of two range images are matched to identify correspondences between them. Correspondences are verified and then used for pairwise registration of the range images. Experimental results show that our algorithm is accurate and efficient. Moreover, it is robust to the resolution of the range images, the number of tensors per view, the required amount of overlap, and noise. Comparisons with the spin image representation revealed that our representation has more discriminating capabilities and performs better at a low resolution of the range images. &copy; 2006 Springer Science + Business Media, Inc.},

	abstract={Shape from focus relies on surface texture for the computation of depth. In many real-world applications, surfaces can be smoothly shaded and lacking in detectable texture. In such cases, shape from focus generates inaccurate and sparse depth maps. This paper presents a novel extension to the original shape from focus method. A strong texture is forced on imaged surfaces by the use of active illumination. The exact pattern of the projected illumination is determined through a careful Fourier analysis of all the optical effects involved in focus analysis. When the focus operator used is a 2D Laplacian, the optimal illumination pattern is found to be a checkerboard whose pitch is the same size as the distance between adjacent elements in the discrete Laplacian kernel. This analysis also reveals the exact number of images required for accurate shape recovery. These results are experimentally verified using an optical microscope. Surfaces lacking in texture, such as, three-dimensional structures on silicon substrates and solder joints on circuit boards were used in the experiments. The results show that the derived illumination pattern is in fact optimal, facilitating accurate shape recovery of complex and pertinent industrial samples},

	abstract={We examine the implications of shape on the process of finding dense correspondence and half-occlusions for a stereo pair of images. The desired property of the disparity map is that it should be a piecewise continuous function which is consistent with the images and which has the minimum number of discontinuities. To zeroth order, piecewise continuity becomes piecewise constancy. Using this approximation, we first discuss an approach for dealing with such a fronto-parallel shapeless world, and the problems involved therein. We then introduce horizontal and vertical slant to create a first order approximation to piecewise continuity. In particular, we emphasize the following geometric fact: a horizontally slanted surface (i.e., having depth variation in the direction of the separation of the two cameras) will appear horizontally stretched in one image as compared to the other image. Thus, while corresponding two images, N pixels on a scanline in one image may correspond to a different number of pixels M in the other image. This leads to three important modifications to existing stereo algorithms: (a) due to unequal sampling, existing intensity matching metrics must be modified, (b) unequal numbers of pixels in the two images must be allowed to correspond to each other, and (c) the uniqueness constraint, which is often used for detecting occlusions, must be changed to an interval uniqueness constraint. We also discuss the asymmetry between vertical and horizontal slant, and the central role of non-horizontal edges in the context of vertical slant. Using experiments, we discuss cases where existing algorithms fail, and how the incorporation of these new constraints provides correct results. &copy; 2005 Springer Science + Business Media, Inc.},

Recently, micro-operations, such as for micro-surgery, DNA manipulations, etc., have gained in importance. However, the small depth of focus of the microscope produces poor observability. For example, if the focus is on the object, the actuator cannot be seen with the microscope. On the other hand, if the focus is on the actuator, the object cannot be observed. In this sense, the 'all-in-focus image', which holds the in-focused texture all over the image, is useful to observe the micro-environments with a microscope. One drawback of the all-in-focus image is that there is no information about the depth of objects. It is also important to obtain the depth map and show the three-dimensional (3D) micro virtual environments in real-time to actuate the micro objects intuitively. First, this paper reviews the criteria of 'depth from focus' to achieve the all-in-focus image and the 3D micro environments' simultaneous reconstruction. After evaluating the validity of this criteria with off-line simulation, a real-time virtual reality (VR) micro camera system is proposed to achieved the micro VR environments with the 'depth from focus' criteria. This system is constructed with a dynamic focusing lens, which can change its focal distance at a high frequency, and a smart vision system, which is capable of capturing and processing the image data in high speed with SIMD architecture.},

	abstract={In this paper, a high-speed digital processed microscopic observational system for telemicrooperation is proposed with a dynamic focusing system and a high-speed digital-processing system using the "depth from focus" criterion. In our previous work [10], we proposed a system that could simultaneously obtain an "all-in-focus image" as well as the "depth" of an object. In reality, in a microoperation, it is not easy to obtain good visibility of objects with a microscope focused at a shallow depth, especially in microsurgery and DNA studies, among other procedures. In this sense, the all-in-focus image, which keeps an in-focus texture over the entire object, is useful for observing microenvironments with the microscope. However, one drawback of the all-in-focus image is that there is no information about the objects' depth. It is also important to obtain a depth map and show the 3D microenvironments at any view angle in real time to actuate the microobjects. Our earlier system with a dynamic focusing lens and a smart sensor could obtain the all-in-focus image and the depth in 2 s. To realize real-time microoperation, a system that could process at least 30 frames per second (60 times faster than the previous system) would be required. This paper briefly reviews the depth from focus criterion to Simultaneously achieve the all-in-focus image and the reconstruction of 3D microenvironments. After discussing the problem inherent in our earlier system, a frame-rate system constructed with a high-speed video camera and FPGA (field programmable gate array) hardware is discussed. To adapt this system for use with the microscope, new criteria to solve the "ghost problem" in reconstructing the all-in-focus image are proposed. Finally, microobservation shows the validity of this system. &copy; Springer-Verlag 2003.},

	abstract={In this paper, a new application system with high speed photography, i.e. an observational system for the tele-micro-operation, has been proposed with a dynamic focusing system and a high-speed image processing system using the "Depth From Focus (DFF)" criteria. In micro operation, such as for the microsurgery, DNA operation and etc., the small depth of a focus on the microscope makes bad observation. For example, if the focus is on the object, the actuator cannot be seen with the microscope. On the other hand, if the focus is on the actuator, the object cannot be observed. In this sense, the "all-in-focus image", which holds the in-focused texture all over the image, is useful to observe the microenvironments on the microscope. It is also important to obtain the "depth map" which could show the 3D micro virtual environments in real-time to actuate the micro objects, intuitively. To realize the real-time micro operation with DFF criteria, which has to integrate several images to obtain "all-in-focus image" and "depth map", at least, the 240 frames par second based image capture and processing system should be required. At first, this paper briefly reviews the criteria of "depth from focus" to achieve the all-in-focus image and the 3D microenvironments' reconstruction, simultaneously. After discussing the problem in our past system, a new frame-rate system is constructed with the high-speed video camera and FPGA hardware with 240 frames par second. To apply this system in the real microscope, a new criterion "ghost filtering" technique to reconstruct the all-in-focus image is proposed. Finally, the micro observation shows the validity of this system.},

	abstract={Outlines a collaborative framework for distributed virtual microscopy.  The requirements are specified in terms of functionality, scalability,  interactivity, and safety and security. To meet these requirements, we  introduce three types of services in the architecture: instrument  services (IS), exchange services (ES) and computational services (CS).  The IS provide an abstraction for manipulating different types of  microscopes; the ES provide common services that are required between  different resources; and the CS provide analytical capabilities for  data analysis and simulation. These services are brought together  through CORBA. Two applications have been introduced into the CS for  analyzing scientific images: in-situ electron microscopy, and recovery  of 3D shape from holographic microscopy. The first application provides  a near-real-time processing of the video-stream for online quantitative  analysis and the use of that information for closed-loop servo control.  The second application reconstructs a 3D representation of an inclusion  from multiple views through holographic electron microscopy. These  applications require steering external stimuli or computational  parameters for a particular result. In a sense,  &ldquo;computational instruments&rdquo; interact closely with  data generated from &ldquo;experimental instruments&rdquo; to  conduct new experiments and bring new functionalities to these  instruments. Both of these features exploit high-performance computing  and low-latency networks to bring novel functionalities to unique  scientific imaging instruments},

	abstract={A method to improve the resolution in depth by applying the depth from focus criteria is proposed. The depth from focus is a criteria used to get simultaneously both the all-in-focus image and three-dimensional information with a single camera. But in these criteria there is a well-known drawback; the resolution is good only at short distances. Here, the optical characteristic that describes the limitation of the measurement range is analyzed. Later, a better criterion to improve the resolution in the depth is proposed by considering the "best focal distance". In order to use this new method, it's necessary to modify the focal distance (zoom) in the camera. Then, an accurate control of the camera should be done to acquire a good view of the desired target and later by applying the depth from focus criteria together with the best focal distance, being able to obtain good depth (three-dimensional) information.},

Experiments are performed using a 2-axis laser interferometer to show that the controller has sub-micron resolution, 2 &micro;m peak-to-peak repeatability, and settling times after trajectories of about 20 ms.

	abstract={In order to make robots more versatile they must be able to operate in a semi-structured work place where unforeseen events occur and where sensor data are incomplete. An entire research community has been working on this problem and many unique autonomous and so-called intelligent robots have been conceived and built. Most of these efforts are concerned with robots that operate in the macroworld where they take on chores that could also be handled by humans. However, there is the microworld in which manipulation and handling tasks are very difficult and for which a human has no tools and where the work area is so small that fine manual manipulation is almost impossible. This paper is concerned with autonomous robots that can operate in a microworld, where microassembly operations, microsurgery or integrated circuit testing and repair is done. For independent operations, these robots need special sensors and an efficient computer architecture that hosts the planner and executor. There are also special drive systems and effectors necessary for micromotions and micromanipulations, respectively. An attempt is made to describe these components and the problems encountered in configuring them to a microrobot. As an example of advanced microrobots, the design and functions of several autonomous microrobots of the University of Karlsruhe are shown; they employ different locomotion and subject handling principles. The paper also includes a discussion of the typical operating problems caused by the microworld and of future research that has to be done to conceive and build efficient microrobots},

	abstract={A common application in microfluidic devices is on-chip capillary electrophoresis (CE). In this process, sample species are transported by electroosmotic flow and separated based on their electrophoretic mobilities. Separated analytes are typically detected using laser-induced fluorescence. It has been found that the sample shape and size, which is critical to the later detection processes or the quality of other analytical techniques, depends on many parameters, such as the sample diffusion coefficient, the applied voltages, and the electrical conductivity difference between sample and buffer. The conductivity difference can alter the electric field strength, which is the driving force behind both the electroosmotic bulk flow and the electrophoretic velocity of individual species. Therefore, the manipulation technique is required to consider the transport processes with conductivity differences. A numerical model presented in this paper is used to simulate the sample transport process with the consideration of conductivity gradient in order to develop the sample manipulation techniques. There are two situations studied here, which are sample pumping (where bulk transport is increased and analyte separation is delayed using a relatively high conductivity sample), and sample stacking (where bulk transport is decreased and analyte separation is expedited using a relatively low conductivity sample). The effects of applied electrical potential, sample diffusion coefficient and the extent of conductivity difference on the sample control are investigated through the developed model. The simulation results show that the sample transport with the consideration of conductivity gradient differs significantly from that of uniform conductivity case.},

A mode diagram is derived to indicate the possible micro-object behavior for the specified operational conditions. Based on the diagram, a reasonable method for pick and place operation is proposed. The keys to successful analysis are to introduce adhesional and rolling-resistance factors into the kinematic system consisting of a sphere, a needle-shaped tool, and a substrate, and to consider the time dependence of these factors due to the electron-beam (EB) irradiation. Adhesional force and the lower limit of maximum rolling resistance are evaluated quantitatively in theoretical and experimental ways. This analysis shows that it is possible to control the fracture of either the tool-sphere or substrate-sphere interface of the system selectively by the tool-loading angle and that such a selective fracture of the interfaces enables reliable pick or place operation even under EB irradiation. Although the conventional micromanipulation was not repeatable because the technique was based on an empirically effective method, this analysis should provide us with a guideline to reliable micromanipulation},

The ability of an intelligent microsystem to adapt itself to the process requirements is ver important, especially for assembly robots. The microrobots should be able to operate in a partially defined environment and to guarantee a reasonable behavior in unpredictable situations. Control methods are needed, which do not require an exact system model and which allow a reasonable compromise between the real-time information processing and the amount of input data; they must also make definite decisions based on vague or incomplete information. Two promising methods are fuzzy control and control by a neural network. The paper presents some approaches to improve the robot behaviour by using these advanced control methods},

	abstract={Micromanipulation by microrobots has become an issue of primary importance in industry and biomedicine, since human manual capabilities are restricted to certain tolerances. The manipulation of biological cells or the assembly of a microsystem composed of several microcomponents are good examples. An automated microrobot-based micromanipulation desktop station has been developed at the University of Karlsruhe. The process of assembly takes place in the field of view of a light optical microscope. This paper focuses on motion control problems of the piezo-driven microrobots employed by the station. The ability to adapt itself to the process requirements is of great importance for micromanipulation robots. They must be able to operate in a partially defined environment and to ensure reasonable behavior in unpredicted situations. A neural control concept based on a reference model is proposed as a solution. It is shown that the neural controller is able to learn the desired behavior. It considerably outperforms an analytically designed linear controller in the real environment.},

	abstract={In the fields of biology, microelectronics and microsystem technology many operations are today performed by hand which might also be done by micromanipulation robots. Several prototypes of such robots have already been built and tested, but in the field of control systems and user interfaces of such micromanipulation systems, there is still much work to be done. Different applications demand different levels of control and planning: easier, single tasks may be performed by teleoperation, while others require a programmed motion sequence or even task planning to accomplish a complex assembly task a with minimum of human interaction. This paper presents a micromanipulation system consisting of a microassembly robot working under a light-optical microscope, a CCD camera and an XY-stage. Then, the software infrastructure for the microrobot control system is presented and the underlying hardware system is described. It also shows a user interface based on this structures, a semi-automated teleoperation system. The user interface presented here uses the live image of the CCD camera to perform either open or closed loop control of the robot's position. All parameters of the microscope and XY-stage can be controlled with dialog windows. The software infrastructure allows also the development of task planning algorithms by providing an intermediate layer to control the robot},

	abstract={Presents a macro/micro robotic probing system developed for the in-circuit test of printed circuit boards (PCBs). Commercially available robotic probing devices are likely to generate excessive contact force due to their uncontrollability, as a rigid probe makes a contact with a less rigid, plastically deformable solder joint at high speed. Since the conventional probing mechanism has only passive compliance, it cannot effectively control such a large contact force. This uncontrollable excessive contact force often makes some defects on the surface of the solder joint and oscillatory motions of the probe, resulting in unreliable test data. In addition, contact with a steep surface of the solder joint makes slip motion of the probe tip onto the surface. To overcome these problems, we propose a serially connected macro and micro robotic probing device equipped with active compliance capability and sensing ability of surface conditions of the solder joint in real-time. The paper describes its design characteristics and control scheme of the newly proposed device. The effectiveness of the proposed probing system is verified through a series of experiments},

	abstract={During the past 20 years, tremendous advancements have been made in the fields of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) and minimally invasive robotic assisted (MIRA) surgery. The technologies associated with these advancements have their own drawbacks, however. The surgical robots used in MIRA procedures are large, costly, and do not offer the miniaturized articulation necessary to facilitate additional advancements. This research tests the hypothesis that miniature actuation can overcome some of the limitations of current robotic systems by demonstrating accurate, repeatable control of a small end-effector. A simple two-link manipulator is designed and fabricated, using antagonistic shape memory alloy (SMA) tendons as actuators, to simulate motions of a surgical end-effector. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are used in conjunction with real-time visual feedback to "learn" the inverse system dynamics and control the manipulator endpoint trajectory. Experimental results are presented for indirect, on-line learning and control. Manipulator tip trajectories are shown to be accurate and repeatable to within 0.5 mm. These results confirm that SMAs can be effective actuators for miniature surgical robotic systems, and that intelligent control can be used to accurately control the trajectory of these systems.},

	abstract={Light field rendering is a fundamental method for synthesizing free-viewpoint images from a set of multi-viewpoint images. In the simplest case, the scene structure is approximated by a simple plane: a focal plane. This approximation leads to focus-like effects on synthetic images where the focused depth is determined by the focal plane. A serious problem is that the range of the focused depth is too small in most practical cases. In this paper, we propose a focus measure that is specialized for synthetic images by light field rendering. When a set of differently-focused images is generated at a given viewpoint, the proposed focus measure enables us to obtain a depth map and an all in-focus image. Our approach has some remarkable differences from other related techniques, such as depth-from-stereo and depth-from-focus methods. Experimental results show that the proposed method effectively enhances PSNR of the final synthetic images. &copy;2004 IEEE.},

	abstract={This paper compares two methods for object localization from contours: shape context and chamfer matching of templates. In the light of our experiments, we suggest improvements to the shape context: Shape contexts are used to find corresponding features between model and image. In real images it is shown that the shape context is highly influenced by clutter, furthermore even when the object is correctly localized, the feature correspondence may be poor. We show that the robustness of shape matching can be increased by including a figural continuity constraint. The combined shape and continuity cost is minimized using the Viterbi algorithm on features, resulting in improved localization and correspondence. Our algorithm can be generally applied to any feature based shape matching method. Chamfer matching correlates model templates with the distance transform of the edge image. This can be done efficiently using a coarse-to-fine search over the transformation parameters. The method is robust in clutter, however multiple templates are needed to handle scale, rotation and shape variation. We compare both methods for locating hand shapes in cluttered images, and applied to word recognition in EZ-Gimpy images.},

	abstract={A fundamental problem in depth from defocus is the measurement of relative defocus between images. The performance of previously proposed focus operators are inevitably sensitive to the frequency spectra of local scene textures. As a result, focus operators such as the Laplacian of Gaussian result in poor depth estimates. An alternative is to use large filter banks that densely sample the frequency space. Though this approach can result in better depth accuracy, it sacrifices the computational efficiency that depth from defocus offers over stereo and structure from motion. We propose a class of broadband operators that, when used together, provide invariance to scene texture and produce accurate and dense depth maps. Since the operators are broadband, a small number of them are sufficient for depth estimation of scenes with complex textural properties. In addition, a depth confidence measure is derived that can be computed from the outputs of the operators. This confidence measure permits further refinement of computed depth maps. Experiments are conducted on both synthetic and real scenes to evaluate the performance of the proposed operators. The depth detection gain error is less than 1%, irrespective of texture frequency. Depth accuracy is found to be 0.5 approx. 1.2% of the distance of the object from the imaging optics.},

One can "travel" in the virtual world by wearing a pair of liquid crystal (LC) glasses, earphone, and holding a 3-D mouse.

	abstract={A wide range of microcomponents can today be produced using various microfabrication techniques. The assembly of complex microsystems consisting of several single components (i. e. hybrid microsystems) is, however, a difficult task that is seen to be a real challenge for the robotic research community. It is necessary to conceive flexible, highly precise and fast microassembly methods. In this paper, the development of a microrobot-based microassembly station is presented. Mobile piezoelectric microrobots with dimensions of some cm0RW1S34RfeSDcfkexd09rT331RW1S34RfeSDcfkexd09rT3 and with at least 5 DOF can perform various manipulations either under a light microscope or inside the vacuum chamber of a scanning electron microscope. The components of the station developed and its control system are described. The latter comprises a vision-based sensor system for automatic robot control and a user interfaces for semi-automated control and teleoperation. First results of the SEM-based micro assembly, handling of biological cells and integration of force micro-sensors into our microrobots are presented as well.},

	abstract={The microrobots, capable of performing microscopic tasks, have become a subject of great interest all over the world. To provide a microrobot with both the transportation and micromanipulation capabilities, various designs of piezoelectric actuators can be used, which can perform very fine positioning in the nm-range. Other qualities of piezoelectric actuators are very fast time of reaction and high forces. This paper is dealing with the motion control of a microrobot, which can be used in different micromanipulation tasks. The robot has three triangularly arranged piezoelectric legs having a tube shape. The paper presents the actuation principle and the motion control approach of the microrobot. The control approach is based on the geometric description of the robot and aims at the following the optimal motion trajectory to minimize the time of movement and to keep the robot endeffector under microscope supervision},

	abstract={Based on small mobile robots the presented MINIMAN system provides a platform for micro-manipulation tasks in very different kinds of applications. Three applications demonstrate the capabilities of the system. Both the high precision assembly of an optical system consisting of three millimeter-sized parts and the positioning of single 20 mu m-cells under a light microscope as well as the handling of tiny samples inside the scanning electron microscope are done by the same kind of robot. For different tasks, the robot is equipped with appropriate tools such as micropipettes or grippers with force and tactile sensors. For the extension to a multi-robot system, it is necessary to further reduce the size of the robots. For the above mentioned robot prototypes a slip-stick driving principle is employed. While this design proves to work very well for the described decimeter-sized robots, it is not suitable for further miniaturized robots because of their reduced inertia. Therefore, the developed centimeter-sized robot is driven by multilayered piezoactuators performing defined steps without a slipping phase. To reduce the number of connecting wires the microrobot has integrated circuits on board. They include high voltage drivers and a serial communication interface for a minimized number of wires},

On the smart sensor, in-focus position is detected pixel by pixel and all-in-focus image can be output in real time. A prototype sensor of 64&times;64 pixels has been designed and fabricated. It can be expected that the smart imaging system is able to generate depth map and all-in-focus images at video rate (30 Hz) or faster because the proposed sensor can operate at more than 1500 fps. This paper also proposes the method of removal and interpolation for depth map to improve accuracy of the depth map. Some experimental results are shown to verify the proposed method of the in-focus detection and the interpolation. And we show design of the proposed sensor.},

	abstract={The depth from focus measurement principle relies on the detection of the optimal focusing distance for measuring the depth map of an object and finding its 3D shape. The principle is most effective at microscopic ranges where it is usually found implemented around a z-controlled microscope and sometimes named multifocus 3D microscopy. As such, the method competes with many other 3D measurement methods showing both advantages and disadvantages. Multifocus 3D microscopy is presented and compared to chromatic aberation, confocal microscopy, white light interferometry. Then, this paper discusses two applications of multifocus 3D microscopy for measuring wood respectively metallic parts in the sub-millimeter range. The first application aims at measuring the topography of wood samples for surface quality control. The wood samples surface topography is evaluated with data obtained from both confocal microscopy and multifocus 3D microscopy. The profiles and a standard roughness factor are compared. The second application concerns the measurement of burrs on metallic parts. Possibilities and limits of multifocus 3D microscopy are presented and discussed.},

	abstract={A large number of 3D cameras suffer from so-called holes in the data, i.e. the measurement lattice is affected by invalid measurements and the range image has undefined values. Conventional image filters used for removing the holes perform not well in presence of holes with large varying hole sizes. The novel hole-filling method presented in this paper operates on reliability attributed range images featuring unwanted holes with wide varying sizes. The method operates according to a multi resolution scheme where the image resolution is decreased at the same time as the range reliability is successively increased until sufficient confidence is reached. It builds on three main components. First, the described process performs a weighted local neighbourhood filter where the contribution of each pixel stands for its reliability. Second, the filtering combines filters with different kernel sizes and implements therefore the multi resolution schema. Third, the processing requires a complete travel from high resolution down to the resolution of satisfactory confidence and back again to the highest resolution. The algorithm for the described method was implemented in a efficient way and was widely applied in the hole-filling of range images from a depth from focus process where reliability is obtainable non-linearly from the local sharpness measurement. The method is valid in a very general way for all range imagers providing reliability information. It seems therefore well suited to depth cameras like time-of-flight, stereo and other similar rangers.},

	abstract={Micro or nano distance manipulations are of prime importance in the MEMS industry. Microdevices are ideal for micropositioning systems due to their small size. Microactuators used to produce small displacements would need large actuation forces and a long driving distance. This would require large voltages to produce the desired forces. Actuators based on impulsive forces provide a solution to this problem. Many impact microactuators have been designed and fabricated in the past decade. Impacts are a source of nonlinearity and a careful study of the dynamics is essential in order to ensure consistent performance of the device. Currently, the state of the art lacks a robust design tool for such devices. The primary goal of this paper is to present a comprehensive modeling and simulation methodology for impact microactuators. The present study will aid in a more robust and consistent impact microactuator design.},

The research in the field of the microfactory and nanofactory addresses these issues. The question is how far and how fast will this miniaturization go? Does it make sense to have a "factory" so small that you can put it on your desk, next to you computer, and start to produce whatever you can imagine? Will personal factories (PF) ever exist? We first present different scenarios of PF. One approach, which is generally favored by physicists, chemists and biologists, is the assembly of atoms or molecules, like LEGO0RW1S34RfeSDcfkexd09rT3(R)1RW1S34RfeSDcfkexd09rT3-bricks, to build up complex devices (bottom up). We will not follow this approach in this paper. The second approach consists of the 3D microstructuring of the parts and their assembly (top down). We briefly present different structuring technologies that could apply in PF. We then briefly present the micro-positioning systems developed at EPFL that can be used for assembly in PF},

	abstract={Similarities between silicon-based micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) and Shape Deposition Manufacturing (SDM) processes are obvious: both integrate additive and subtractive processes and use part and sacrificial materials to obtain functional structures. These MEMS techniques are two-dimensional (2-D) processes for a limited number of materials while SDM enables the building of parts that have traditionally been impossible to fabricate because of their complex shapes or of their variety in materials. This work presents initial results on the development of a micro rapid prototyping system that adapts SDM methodology to micro-fabrication. This system is designed to incorporate microdeposition and laser micromachining. In the hope of obtaining a precise microdeposition, an ultrasonic-based micro powder-feeding mechanism was developed in order to form thin patterns of dry powders that can be cladded or sintered onto a substrate by a micro-sized laser beam. Furthermore, experimental results on laser micromachining using a laser beam with a wavelength of 355 nm are also presented. After further improvement, the developed micro manufacturing system could take computer-aided design (CAD) output to reproduce 3-D heterogeneous microcomponents from a wide selection of materials},

	abstract={We introduce a novel view-based object representation, called the saliency map graph (SMG), which captures the salient regions of an object view at multiple scales using a wavelet transform. This compact representation is highly invariant to translation, rotation (image and depth), and scaling, and offers the locality of representation required for occluded object recognition. To compare two saliency map graphs, we introduce two graph similarity algorithms. The first computes the topological similarity between two SMGs, providing a coarse-level matching of two graphs. The second computes the geometrical similarity between two SMGs, providing a fine-level matching of two graphs. We test and compare these two algorithms on a large database of model object views},

The major contribution of this work is that it generalizes the real and complex wavelet transforms and derives a quaternionic wavelet pyramid for multi-resolution analysis using the quaternionic phase concept. As a illustration we present an application of the discrete QWT for optical flow estimation. For the estimation of motion through different resolution levels we use a similarity distance evaluated by means of the quaternionic phase concept and a confidence mask. We show that this linear approach is amenable to be extended to a kind of quadratic interpolation. &copy; 2006 Springer Science + Business Media, Inc.},

	abstract={Two approaches are described that improve the efficiency of optical flow computation without incurring loss of accuracy. The first approach segments images into regions of moving objects. The method is based on a previously defined Galerkin finite element method on a triangular mesh combined with a multiresolution segmentation approach for object flow computation. Images are automatically segmented into subdomains of moving objects by an algorithm that employs a hierarchy of mesh coarseness for the flow computation, and these subdomains are reconstructed over a finer mesh on which to recompute flow more accurately. The second approach uses an adaptive mesh in which the resolution increases where motion is found to occur. Optical flow is computed over a reasonably coarse mesh, and this is used to construct an optimal adaptive mesh in a way that is different from the gradient methods reported in the literature. The finite element mesh facilitates a reduction in computational effort by enabling processing to focus on particular objects of interest in a scene (i.e. those areas where motion is detected). The proposed methods were tested on real and synthetic image sequences, and promising results are reported},

	abstract={In this paper we define a complete framework for processing large image sequences for a global monitoring of short range oceanographic and atmospheric processes. This framework is based on the use of a non quadratic regularization technique for optical flow computation that preserves flow discontinuities. We also show that using an appropriate tessellation of the image according to an estimate of the motion field can improve optical flow accuracy and yields more reliable flows. This method defines a non uniform multiresolution approach for coarse to fine grid generation. It allows to locally increase the resolution of the grid according to the studied problem. Each added node refines the grid in a region of interest and increases the numerical accuracy of the solution in this region. We make use of such a method for solving the optical flow equation with a non quadratic regularization scheme allowing the computation of optical flow field while preserving its discontinuities. The second part of the paper deals with the interpretation of the obtained displacement field. For this purpose a phase portrait model used along with a new formulation of the approximation of an oriented flow field allowing to consider arbitrary polynomial phase portrait models for characterizing salient flow features. This new framework is used for processing oceanographic and atmospheric image sequences and presents an alternative to complex physical modeling techniques},

	abstract={Quadrature filters are a well known method of low-level computer vision for estimating certain properties of the signal, as there are local amplitude and local phase. However, 2D quadrature filters suffer from being not rotation invariant. Furthermore, they do not allow to detect truly 2D features as corners and junctions unless they are combined to form the structure tensor. This paper deals with a new 2D generalization of quadrature filters which is rotation invariant and allows to analyze intrinsically 2D signals. Hence, the new approach can be considered as the union of properties of quadrature filters and of the structure tensor. The proposed method first estimates the local orientation of the signal which is then used for steering some basic filter responses. Certain linear combination of these filter responses are derived which allow to estimate the local isotropy and two perpendicular phases of the signal. The phase model is based on the assumption of an angular band-limitation in the signal. As an application, a simple and efficient point-of-interest operator is presented and it is compared to the Plessey detector},

It also allows for an efficient on-line adjustment of the trade off between the speed and the accuracy of the filters.

	abstract={Two new two dimensional (2-D) complex operators for estimating the energy and orientation of 2-D oriented patterns are proposed. The starting point for our work is a new 2-D extension of the Teager-Kaiser energy operator incorporating orientation estimation. The first new energy operator is based on partial derivatives and can be considered a local (point-based) estimator. Using a nonlocal (pseudo-differential) operator we derive a second and more general energy operator. A scale invariant nonlocal operator is derived from the recently proposed spiral phase quadrature (or Riesz) transform. The Teager-Kaiser energy operator and the phase congruency local energy are unified in a single equation for both 1-D and 2-D. Robust orientation estimation, important for isotropic demodulation of fringe patterns is demonstrated. Theoretical error analysis of the local operator is greatly simplified by a logarithmic formulation. Experimental results using the operators on noisy images are shown. In the presence of Gaussian additive noise both the local and nonlocal operators give improved performance when compared with a simple gradient based estimator},

The channels are characterized by a bank of Gabor filters that nearly uniformly covers the spatial-frequency domain, and a systematic filter selection scheme is proposed, which is based on reconstruction of the input image from the filtered images. Texture features are obtained by subjecting each (selected) filtered image to a nonlinear transformation and computing a measure of energy in a window around each pixel. A square-error clustering algorithm is then used to integrate the feature images and produce a segmentation. A simple procedure to incorporate spatial information in the clustering process is proposed. A relative index is used to estimate the `true' number of texture categories},

Harris-Laplace interest points characterized by scale-invariant transformation feature descriptors are used as natural landmarks.

Coarse localization from the LVSM is fast, but not accurate enough, whereas localization from the location database using a voting algorithm is relatively slow, but more accurate. The integration of coarse and fine stages makes fast and reliable localization possible. If necessary, the localization result can be verified by epipolar geometry between the representative view in the database and the view to be localized. In addition, the localization system recovers the position of the camera by essential matrix decomposition. The localization system has been tested in indoor and outdoor environments. The results show that our approach is efficient and reliable. &copy; 2006 IEEE.},

	abstract={We examine the role and potential application areas of machine vision inspection systems in the printed circuit board (PCB) manufacturing industry. Available automatic optical inspection (AOI) techniques are reviewed, this revealing limitations which stem mainly from the stand-alone operational nature of the present-generation AOI systems. As a result the authors argue that, fuelled by the need to achieve integration and information sharing between AOI systems and other components of computerized manufacturing systems, it is necessary to define architectural guidelines that structure the way in which next generation AOI systems should be organized in order to enable them to share information of a common interest and cooperate on an enterprise-wide basis. We also examine typical applications of AOI in PCB manufacture. Upon extracting common features of these applications, a model of AOI task decomposition is proposed, which characterizes the main features of the two major subtasks that an AOI system needs to perform; so that it can benefit from information sharing and improve its performance in terms of providing more valuable and reusable inspection information to other computerized systems and processes. These two subtasks are (1) an initial local inspection subtask, and (2) a global inspection, analysis and inspection information generation subtask. The importance of the second subtask relates to the general requirement for AOI systems not only simply to automate PCB inspection processes, but also to provide readily reusable inspection information that can be utilized to support other relevant manufacturing processes. Based on the AOI task decomposition model, we propose a hierarchical architecture which can structure the design, implementation and re-organisation of AOI software algorithms and routines, in such a way that typical AOI operations can be enhanced, this through making use of available global information, and that more widespread, efficient and timely use of AOI-generated inspection information can be made by other manufacturing processes. Finally, a proof-of-concept implementation of the AOI reference architecture is described.},

	abstract={A common need in machine vision is to compute the 3-D rigid body transformation that aligns two sets of points for which correspondence is known. A comparative analysis is presented here of four popular and efficient algorithms, each of which computes the translational and rotational components of the transform in closed form, as the solution to a least squares formulation of the problem. They differ in terms of the transformation representation used and the mathematical derivation of the solution, using respectively singular value decomposition or eigensystem computation based on the standard [R,T] representation, and the eigensystem analysis of matrices derived from unit and dual quaternion forms of the transform. This comparison presents both qualitative and quantitative results of several experiments designed to determine (1) the accuracy and robustness of each algorithm in the presence of different levels of noise, (2) the stability with respect to degenerate data sets, and (3) relative computation time of each approach under different conditions. The results indicate that under &ldquo;ideal&rdquo; data conditions (no noise) certain distinctions in accuracy and stability can be seen. But for &ldquo;typical, real-world&rdquo; noise levels, there is no difference in the robustness of the final solutions (contrary to certain previously published results). Efficiency, in terms of execution time, is found to be highly dependent on the computer system setup},

As a consequence, they are only suited to multi-dimensional signals which are intrinsically one-dimensional. We claim that this restriction is due to the restricted algebraic frame used in signal processing, especially to the use of the complex numbers in the frequency domain. We propose a generalization of the two-dimensional Fourier transform which yields a quaternionic signal representation. We call this transform the quaternionic Fourier transform (QFT). Based on the QFT, we generalize the conceptions of the analytic signal, Gabor filters, instantaneous and local phase to two dimensions in a novel way which is intrinsically two-dimensional.

	pages={54-105},
	abstract={This paper shows the design and use of feed-forward neural networks and the support vector machines (SVM) in the coordinate-free mathematical system of the Clifford geometric algebra. We compare the McCulloch-Pitts neuron and the geometric neuron. An interesting case of the geometric neuron is the conformal neuron which can be used for RBF networks and SVM. The paper presents the generalization of the real- and complex-valued multilayer perceptron (MLP) to the Clifford valued multilayer perceptron. The paper studies also the multivector support vector machines (MSVM) which are SVMs for processing multivectors. For that we design kernels involving Clifford products. The resultant kernel resembles a sort of polynomial kernel using a multivector representation. In the context of SVMs an important contribution of the paper is the generalization of the real- and complex-valued SVM classifiers over the hyper-complex numbers. This Clifford valued SVM accepts multiple multivector inputs and it is a multi-class classifier. For the preprocessing the authors introduce a promising geometric method utilizing Clifford moments. This method is applied together with geometric MLPs for tasks of 2D pattern recognition. The experimental part shows applications of SVM using the conformal neuron and Clifford kernels. We include challenging applications of the Clifford SVM classifier for nonlinear separable problems. The authors believe that the use of the MLPs and SVMs in the geometric algebra framework expands their sphere of applicability for multivector learning in graded spaces.

This paper is not a formal survey of reuse technology but instead discusses the evolution of early concepts and the issues they raise. Much of the research of the original workshop participants is just now becoming relevant. In some cases the research of the past points to problems and solutions for the present.

	abstract={Component-based development leverages software reusability and reduces development costs. Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) is a component model developed to reduce the complexity of software development and to facilitate reuse of components. However, EJB does not support component assembly by a plug-and-play technique due to the hard-wired composition at the code level. To cope with this problem, an architecture for EJB component assembly is defined at the abstract level and the inconsistency between the system architecture and its implementation must be eliminated at the implementation level. We propose a component-based application development tool named the COBALT assembler that supports the design and implementation of EJB component assembly by a plug-and-play technique based on the architecture style. The system architecture is first defined by the Architecture Description Language (ADL). The wrapper code and glue code are then generated for the assembly. After the consistency between the architecture and its implementation is checked, the assembled EJB components are deployed in an application server as a new composite component. We use the COBALT assembler for a shopping mall system and demonstrate that it can promote component reuse and leverage the system maintainability.},

The foundation of the Chimera methodology is the port-based object model of a reusable software component. The model is obtained by applying the port-automaton formal computational model to object-based design. Global state variable table real-time communication is used to integrate port-based objects, which eliminates the need for writing and debugging glue code. The Chimera real-time operating system provides tools to support the software models defined by the Chimera methodology, so that real-time software can be executed predictably using common real-time scheduling algorithms. A hypermedia user interface has been designed to allow users to easily assemble the real-time software components that are designed based on the Chimera methodology. Use of the methodology can result in a significant decrease the development time and cost of real-time applications.},

	abstract={The basic and widely used edge detection operation in an image usually requires a prior step of setting the edge detector parameters (thresholds, blurring extent etc.). Finding the best detector parameters automatically in real-world images is a difficult challenge because no absolute ground truth exists. However, the advantage of automatic processing over manual operations done by humans motivates the development of automatic detector parameter selection. In this work, we propose an automatic detector parameter selection which considers both, statistical correspondence of detection results produced from different detector parameters, and spatial correspondence between detected edge points, represented as saliency values. The method improves a recently developed technique that employs only statistical correspondence of detection results and depends on the initial parameter range by incorporating saliency values in the statistical analysis. Automatic edge detection results show considerable improvement of the purely statistical method when a wrong initial parameter range is selected. &copy; 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

We present a complete framework that starts with the extraction of various local regions of either discontinuity or homogeneity. A variety of local descriptors can be applied to form a set of feature vectors for each local region. Boosting is used to learn a subset of such feature vectors (weak hypotheses) and to combine them into one final hypothesis for each visual category. This combination of individual extractors and descriptors leads to recognition rates that are superior to other approaches which use only one specific extractor/ descriptor setting. To explore the limitation of our system, we had to set up new, highly complex image databases that show the objects of interest at varying scales and poses, in cluttered background, and under considerable occlusion. We obtain classification results up to 81 percent ROC-equal error rate on the most complex of our databases. Our approach outperforms all comparable solutions on common databases. &copy; 2006 IEEE.},

	abstract={This paper presents a unified approach to automatically build dynamic and multi-resolution 360&deg; panoramic (DMP) representations from image sequences captured by hand-held cameras mainly undertaking rotation and zooming for natural scenes with moving targets. A simple (yet stable) rigid motion model and a closed-loop-based mosaicing algorithm are proposed to generate cylindrical mosaics automatically. Multi-resolution representations are built for interesting areas by separating zooming sub-sequences from a pan/zoom sequence. Moving objects are detected and separated from images based on motion information, and then more accurate contours are extracted using a modified active contour algorithm. The DMP construction method is fast, robust, and automatic, achieving five frames per second for image sequences with 384&times;288 color images on a Pentium III 800MHz PC. The construction of the DMP representation can be used in virtual reality, video surveillance, and very low bit-rate video coding. [All rights reserved Elsevier]},

	abstract={Histograms of shape signature or prototypical shapes, called shapemes, have been used effectively in previous work for 2D/3D shape matching and recognition. We extend the idea of shapeme histogram to recognize partially observed query objects from a database of complete model objects. We propose representing each model object as a collection of shapeme histograms and match the query histogram to this representation in two steps: 1) compute a constrained projection of the query histogram onto the subspace spanned by all the shapeme histograms of the model and 2) compute a match measure between the query histogram and the projection. The first step is formulated as a constrained optimization problem that is solved by a sampling algorithm. The second step is formulated under a Bayesian framework, where an implicit feature selection process is conducted to improve the discrimination capability of shapeme histograms. Results of matching partially viewed range objects with a 243 model database demonstrate better performance than the original shapeme histogram matching algorithm and other approaches. &copy; 2006 IEEE.},

The learning procedure results from the matching pursuit algorithm, while the recognition is based on polynomial approximation to the bases, turning image matching into a problem of polynomial evaluation. The method is suited for coarse recognition between objects and, by adding more bases, also for fine recognition of the object pose. The advantages over the common representation using PCA include storing sampled points for recognition is not required, adding new objects to an existing data set is trivial because retraining other object models is not needed, and significantly in the important case where one has to scan an image over multiple locations in search for an object, the new representation is readily available as opposed to PCA projection at each location. The experimental result on the COIL-100 data set demonstrates high recognition accuracy with real-time performance. &copy; 2006 IEEE.},

	abstract={We present an approach to recognition of complex objects in cluttered three-dimensional (3D) scenes that does not require feature extraction or segmentation. Our object representation comprises descriptive images associated with oriented points on the surface of an object. Using a single point basis constructed from an oriented point, the position of other points on the surface of the object can be described by two parameters. The accumulation of these parameters for many points on the surface of the object results in an image at each oriented point. These images, localized descriptions of the global shape of the object, are invariant to rigid transformations. Through correlation of images, point correspondences between a model and scene data are established. Geometric consistency is used to group the correspondences from which plausible rigid transformations that align the model with the scene are calculated. The transformations are then refined and verified using a modified iterative closest point algorithm. The effectiveness of our representation comes from its ability to combine the descriptive nature of global object properties with the robustness to partial views and clutter of local shape descriptions. The wide applicability of our algorithm is demonstrated with results showing recognition of complex objects in cluttered scenes with occlusion},

	abstract={The nearest- or near-neighbor query problems arise in a large variety  of database applications, usually in the context of similarity  searching. Of Late, there has been increasing interest in building  search/index structures for performing similarity search over  high-dimensional data, e.g., image databases, document collections,  time-series databases, and genome databases. Unfortunately, all known  techniques for solving this problem fall prey to the &ldquo;curse  of dimensionality&rdquo;. That is, the data structures scale poorly  with data dimensionality; in fact, if the number of dimensions exceeds  10 to 20, searching in k-d trees and related structures involves the  inspection of a large fraction of the database, thereby doing no better  than brute-force linear search. It has been suggested that since the  selection of features and the choice of a distance metric in typical  applications is rather heuristic, determining an approximate nearest  neighbor should suffice for most practical purposes. We examine a novel  scheme for approximate similarity search based on hashing. The basic  idea is to hash the points from the database so as to ensure that the  probability of collision is much higher for objects that are close to  each other than for those that are far apart. We provide experimental  evidence that our method gives significant improvement in running time  over other methods for searching in high-dimensional spaces based on  hierarchical tree decomposition. Experimental results also indicate  that our scheme scales well even for a relatively large number of  dimensions (more than 50)},

	abstract={Feature space analysis is the main module in many computer vision tasks. The most popular technique, k-means clustering, however, has two inherent limitations: the clusters are constrained to be spherically symmetric and their number has to be known a priori. In nonparametric clustering methods, like the orfe based on mean shift, these limitations are eliminated but the amount of computation becomes prohibitively large as the dimension of the space increases. We exploit a recently proposed approximation technique, locality-sensitive hashing (LSH), to reduce the computational complexity of adaptive mean shift. In our implementation of LSH the optimal parameters of the data structure are determined by a pilot learning procedure, and the partitions are data driven. As an application, the performance of mode and k-means based textons are compared in a texture classification study.},

	abstract={Particle filtering is a very popular technique for sequential state estimation. However, in high-dimensional cases where the state dynamics are complex or poorly modeled, thousands of particles are usually required for real applications. This paper presents a hybrid sampling solution that combines RANSAC and particle filtering. In this approach, RANSAC provides proposal particles that, with high probability, represent the observation likelihood. Both conditionally independent RANSAC sampling and boosting-like conditionally dependent RANSAC sampling are explored. We show that the use of RANSAC-guided sampling reduces the necessary number of particles to dozens for a full 3D tracking problem. This method is particularly advantageous when state dynamics are poorly modeled. We show empirically that the sampling efficiency (in terms of likelihood) is much higher with the use of RANSAC. The algorithm has been applied to the problem of 3D face pose tracking with changing expression. We demonstrate the validity of our approach with several video sequences acquired in an unstructured environment. &copy; 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract={Over the past few years researchers have been investigating the enhancement of visual tracking performance by devising trackers that simultaneously make use of several different features. In this paper we investigate the combination of synchronous visual trackers that use different features while treating the trackers as "black boxes". That is, instead of fusing the usage of the different types of data as has been performed in previous work, the combination here is allowed to use only the trackers' output estimates, which may be modified before their propagation to the next time step. We propose a probabilistic framework for combining multiple synchronous trackers, where each separate tracker outputs a probability density function of the tracked state, sequentially for each image. The trackers may output either an explicit probability density function, or a sample-set of it via CONDENSATION. Unlike previous tracker combinations, the proposed framework is fairly general and allows the combination of any set of trackers of this kind, even in different state-spaces of different dimensionality, under a few reasonable assumptions. The combination may consist of different trackers that track a common object, as well as trackers that track separate, albeit related objects, thus improving the tracking performance of each object. The benefits of merely using the final estimates of the separate trackers in the combination are twofold. Firstly, the framework for the combination is fairly general and may be easily used from the software aspects. Secondly, the combination may be performed in a distributed setting, where each separate tracker runs on a different site and uses different data, while avoiding the need to share the data. The suggested framework was successfully tested using various state-spaces and datasets, demonstrating that fusing the trackers' final distribution estimates may indeed be applicable. &copy; 2006 Springer-Science + Business Media, Inc.},

	abstract={A novel corner detection algorithm is presented which can be used to camera calibration methods where square comers are used as control points. Corners are detected with sub-pixel accuracy, using a segmentation method for separation of each square, based on seeds. These are pixels with a predefined color or gray value. An 11&times;11 proper developed template, including pixels of the predefined color or gray value, convoluted with the corresponding square gives pixels related with a corner. The mean value of this cluster of pixels provides with sub-pixel accuracy the co-ordinates of the specified corner. Corners co-ordinates are calculated with the specified sequence of the camera calibration method. Corners are found even in cases where the square slope is big or the barrel phenomenon distorts too much the image. The software interface was made in visual C++. Some of its features are the possibility to change the scanning area making the algorithm faster or more reliable, saving facilities for the converted binary image and for the final corners file, model file creation. This program is part of a software application where images can be easily captured using a camera mounted on the end effector of PUMA 761 robotic manipulator and calibration is made through Z.

Particularly, the generation of RBF for neurocomputing in geometric algebra is easier using the SMVM that allows to find the optimal parameters automatically. The use of SVM in the geometric algebra framework expands its sphere of applicability for multidimensional learning. We introduce a novel method of geometric preprocessing utilizing hypercomplex or Clifford moments. This method is applied together with geometric MLPs for tasks of 2D pattern recognition.

	abstract={Based on small mobile robots the presented MINIMAN system provides a platform for micro-manipulation tasks in very different kinds of applications. Three exemplary applications demonstrate the capabilities of the system. Both the high precision assembly of an optical system consisting of three millimeter-sized parts and the positioning of single 20-&mu;m-cells under the light microscope as well as the handling of tiny samples inside the scanning electron microscope are done by the same kind of robot. For the different tasks, the robot is equipped with appropriate tools such as micropipettes or grippers with force and tactile sensors. For the extension to a multi-robot system, it is necessary to further reduce the size of robots. For the above mentioned robot prototypes a slip-stick driving principle is employed. While this design proves to work very well for the described decimeter-sized robots, it is not suitable for further miniaturized robots because of their reduced inertia. Therefore, the developed centimeter-sized robot is driven by multilayered piezoactuators performing defined steps without a slipping phase. To reduce the number of connecting wires the microrobot has integrated circuits on board. They include high voltage drivers and a serial communication interface for a minimized number of wires.},

Fundamentally, this problem requires recognition, as we need to know which parts of the panorama join up. Previous approaches have used human input or restrictions on the image sequence for the matching step. In this work we use object recognition techniques based on invariant local features to select matching images, and a probabilistic model for verification. Because of this our method is insensitive to the ordering, orientation, scale and illumination of the images. It is also insensitive to 'noise' images which are not part of the panorama at all, that is, it recognises panoramas. This suggests a useful application for photographers: the system takes as input the images on an entire flash card or film, recognises images that form part of a panorama, and stitches them with no user input whatsoever.},

Category  models are probabilistic constellations of parts, and their parameters  are estimated by maximizing the likelihood of the training data. The  appearance of the parts, as well as their mutual position, relative  scale and probability of detection are explicitly described in the  model. Recognition takes place in two stages. First, a feature-finder  identifies promising locations for the model”s parts. Second, the  category model is used to compare the likelihood that the observed  features are generated by the category model, or are generated by  background clutter.

	abstract={A novel approach to visual servoing is presented, which takes advantage of the structure of the Lie algebra of affine transformations. The aim of this project is to use feedback from a visual sensor to guide a robot arm to a target position. The target position is learned using the principle of 'teaching by showing' in which the supervisor places the robot in the correct target position and the system captures the necessary information to be able to return to that position. The sensor is placed in the end effector of the robot, the 'camera-in-hand' approach, and thus provides direct feedback of the robot motion relative to the target scene via observed transformations of the scene. These scene transformations are obtained by measuring the affine deformations of a target planar contour (under the weak perspective assumption), captured by use of an active contour, or snake. Deformations of the snake are constrained using the Lie groups of affine and projective transformations. Properties of the Lie algebra of affine transformations are exploited to provide a novel method for integrating observed deformations of the target contour. These can be compensated with appropriate robot motion using a non-linear control structure. The local differential representation of contour deformations is extended to allow accurate integration of an extended series of small perturbations. This differs from existing approaches by virtue of the properties of the Lie algebra representation which implicity embeds knowledge of the three-dimensional world within a two-dimensional image-based system. These techniques have been implemented using a video camera to control a 5 DoF robot arm. Experiments with this implementation are presented, together with a discussion of the results.},

	abstract={Neurons in the central visual pathways process visual images within a  localized region of space and a restricted epoch of time. Although the  receptive field (RF) of a visually-responsive neuron is inherently a  spatiotemporal entity, most studies have focused exclusively on spatial  aspects of RF structure. Recently, however, the application of  sophisticated RF mapping techniques has enabled neurophysiologists to  characterize RFs in the joint domain of space and time. Studies  employing these techniques have revealed that neurons in the  geniculostriate pathway exhibit striking RF dynamics. For a majority of  cells, the spatial structure of the RF changes as a function of time;  thus, these RFs can be adequately characterized only in the space-time  domain. In this review, we focus on the spatiotemporal RF structure of  neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus and primary visual cortex,  highlighting some of the implications of recent findings for  understanding early visual processing.}

	abstract={This paper describes a novel multi-view matching framework based on a new type of invariant feature. Our features are located at Harris corners in discrete scale-space and oriented using a blurred local gradient. This defines a rotationally invariant frame in which we sample a feature descriptor, which consists of an 8 &times; 8 patch of bias/gain normalised intensity values. The density of features in the image is controlled using a novel adaptive non-maximal suppression algorithm, which gives a better spatial distribution of features than previous approaches. Matching is achieved using a fast nearest neighbour algorithm that indexes features based on their low frequency Haar wavelet coefficients. We also introduce a novel outlier rejection procedure that verifies a pairwise feature match based on a background distribution of incorrect feature matches. Feature matches are refined using RANSAC and used in an automatic 2D panorama stitcher that has been extensively tested on hundreds of sample inputs},

	journal={Videre},
	volume={1},
	number={3},
	abstract={Image features such as step edges, lines, and Mach bands all give rise to points where the Fourier components of the image are maximally in phase. The use of phase congruency for marking features has significant advantages over gradient-based methods. Phase congruency is a dimensionless quantity that is invariant to changes in image brightness or contrast; hence, it provides an absolute measure of the significance of feature points, thus allowing the use of universal threshold values that can be applied over wide classes of images. This paper presents a new measure of phase congruency and shows how it can be calculated through the use of wavelets. The existing theory that has been developed for l-D signals is extended to allow the calculation of phase congruency in 2-D images. It is shown that, for good localization, it is important to consider the spread of frequencies present at a point of phase congruency. An effective method for identifying and compensating for the level of noise in an image is presented. Finally, it is argued that high-pass filtering should be used to obtain image information at different scales. With this approach, the choice of scale affects only the relative significance of features without degrading their localization},

	pages={137-54},
	abstract={Inferring scene geometry and camera motion from a stream of images is possible in principle, but is an ill-conditioned problem when the objects are distant with respect to their size. The authors have developed a factorization method that can overcome this difficulty by recovering shape and motion under orthography without computing depth as an intermediate step. An image stream can be represented by the measurement matrix of the image coordinates of points tracked through frames. The authors show that under orthographic projection this matrix is of rank 3. Based on this observation, the factorization method uses the singular-value decomposition technique to factor the measurement matrix into two matrices which represent object shape and camera rotation respectively. Two of the three translation components are computed in a preprocessing stage. The method can also handle and obtain a full solution from a partially filled-in measurement matrix that may result from occlusions or tracking failures. The method gives accurate results, and does not introduce smoothing in either shape or motion. The authors demonstrate this with a series of experiments on laboratory and outdoor image streams, with and without occlusions},

Although tracking itself is by and large a solved problem, selecting features that can be tracked well and correspond to physical points in the world is still hard. We propose a feature selection criterion that is optimal by construction because it is based on how the tracker works, and a feature monitoring method that can detect occlusions, disocclusions, and features that do not correspond to points in the world. These methods are based on a new tracking algorithm that extends previous Newton-Raphson style search methods to work under affine image transformations. We test performance with several simulations and experiments.},

	abstract={A system is presented that takes a gray level image as input, locates edges with subpixel accuracy, and links them into lines. Edges are detected by finding zero-crossings in the convolution of the image with Laplacian-of-Gaussian (LoG) masks. The masks are decomposed exactly into a sum of two separate filters instead of the usual approximation by a difference of two Gaussians. Subpixel accuracy is obtained through the use of the facet model. It is noted that while the zero-crossings obtained from the full resolution image using a space constant &sigma; for the Gaussian are very similar to those obtained from the resol
ution image with pixel accuracy and a space constant of for the Gaussian, the processing times are very different. Finally, these edges are grouped into lines using the technique described by R. Nevatia and K.R. Babu (Comput. Graphics Image Proc., vol.13, p.257-69, 1980)},

They have also been used as tools in the development process of computer programs, starting from the specification and ending with the coding and testing phases. In this way one can exploit their powerful mathematical capacity during the development phases and, by the other way, take advantage of the speed performance of languages such as FORTRAN or C in the implementation. Among the mathematical features of CASs there are transformations allowing one to optimize the final code instructions. In this paper we show some kind of optimizations that can be done on new or existing algorithms, by extending some techniques that compilers apply currently to optimize the machine code. The results show that the CPU time taken by the optimized code is reduced by a factor that can reach 5. The optimizations are performed with a package built on a well known CAS: Mathematica.

	abstract={Noise filtering of images is essentially a smoothing process, and it is an issue that has been addressed for many years. The most commonly used low-pass filtering methods blur important image structures such as edges and lines, and thus reduce image contrast and damage image fidelity. This paper presents a structure adaptive anisotropic filtering technique with its application to processing magnetic resonance images. It differs from other techniques in that, instead of using local gradients as a means of controlling the anisotropism of filters, it uses both a local intensity orientation, and an anisotropic measure of level contours to control the shape and extent of the filter kernel. This ensures that corners and junctions are well preserved throughout the filtering process. The following two aspects of the proposed technique demonstrate the advantage of using this filtering method. Firstly, the use of local orientation detection provides a robust and convenient way for shaping the filter kernel. Secondly, the structural adaptiveness of the filtering process ensures that salient image features are non-symmetrically enhanced},

	abstract={In this paper, we present an analytic solution to the problem of estimating an unknown number of 2-D and 3-D motion models from two-view point correspondences or optical flow. The key to our approach is to view the estimation of multiple motion models as the estimation of a single multibody motion model. This is possible thanks to two important algebraic facts. First, we show that all the image measurements, regardless of their associated motion model, can be fit with a single real or complex polynomial. Second, we show that the parameters of the individual motion model associated with an image measurement can be obtained from the derivatives of the polynomial at that measurement. This leads to an algebraic motion segmentation and estimation algorithm that applies to most of the two-view motion models that have been adopted in computer vision. Our experiments show that the proposed algorithm out-performs existing algebraic and factorization-based methods in terms of efficiency and robustness, and provides a good initialization for iterative techniques, such as Expectation Maximization, whose performance strongly depends on good initialization. &copy; 2006 Springer Science + Business Media, LLC.},

We have called the resulting imaging system SICONS (SIngle Chip Optical Navigation Sensor).

We then show that the condition for inversion of the DWT (perfect reconstruction) forces many commonly used wavelets to be similar in shape, and that this shape produces severe shift dependence (variation of DWT coefficient energy at any given scale with shift of the input signal). It is also shown that separable filtering with the DWT prevents the transform from providing directionally selective filters for diagonal image features. Complex wavelets can provide both shift invariance and good directional selectivity, with only modest increases in signal redundancy and computation load. However, development of a complex wavelet transform (CWT) with perfect reconstruction and good filter characteristics has proved difficult until recently. We now propose the dual-tree CWT as a solution to this problem, yielding a transform with attractive properties for a range of signal and image processing applications, including motion estimation, denoising, texture analysis and synthesis, and object segmentation},

Our local model computes the motion by the linear evaluation of the disparity equations involving the three phases of the quaternion detail high-pass filters.

The wavelet decomposition of the face image leads to a wavelet subband representation, which contains four subband images corresponding to four orthogonal channels. These four subbands can be encoded into a 2-D quaternion number array. The quaternion correlation filter method is developed for performing pattern recognition on multichannel 2-D signal jointly. The proposed method has been shown to achieve significant improvement in face recognition results compared to traditional advanced correlation filter method for handling illumination variations of face images. We experimented with the CMU PIE database consisting of 65 people with 21 illumination variations per person, showing that our method can achieve close to 100\% recognition accuracy using just a single training image of a person under neutral frontal lighting and testing on all other un-seen harsh illuminations. &copy; 2005 IEEE.},

It is different from the current uncalibrated matching techniques, most of which obtain 2D dense disparity map after the epipolar geometry has been recovered. In this paper, the disparity is directly estimated by simply establishing correspondences between quaternionic phase structures of two QWF (quaternion wavelet filtered) images. Real and short-length biorthogonal wavelet bases are exploited to build linear-phase quaternion wavelet filters (LPQWFs). Once phases are extracted from the QWF image pair, the disparity estimation is formed as a minimization process of a cost function, which is formulated as a similarity measure for comparing quaternion wavelet phases. With regard to the mismatches near phase singularities, phase stability constraints are imposed on cost aggregation stage. And multi-scale matching strategy is introduced to avoid phase wrapping problem and improve convergence speed. The experimental results are encouraging in various image pairs},

	abstract={The construction of Gabor's (1946) complex signal-which is also known as the analytic signal-provides direct access to a real one-dimensional (1-D) signal's local amplitude and phase. The complex signal is built from a real signal by adding its Hilbert transform-which is a phase-shifted version of the signal-as an imaginary part to the signal. Since its introduction, the complex signal has become an important tool in signal processing, with applications, for example, in narrowband communication. Different approaches to an n-D analytic or complex signal have been proposed in the past. We review these approaches and propose the hypercomplex signal as a novel extension of the complex signal to n-D. This extension leads to a new definition of local phase, which reveals information on the intrinsic dimensionality of the signal. The different approaches are unified by expressing all of them as combinations of the signal and its partial and total Hilbert transforms. Examples that clarify how the approaches differ in their definitions of local phase and amplitude are shown. An example is provided for the two-dimensional (2-D) hypercomplex signal, which shows how the novel phase concept can be used in texture segmentation},

	abstract={Summary form only given. A fundamental issue in the problem of finding an efficient algorithm for estimation of 3-D orientation is how 3-D orientation should be represented. A representation is regarded as suitable if it meets the three basic requirements of uniqueness, uniformity, and polar separability. A tensor representation suitable in the above sense has been obtained. The uniqueness requirement implies a mapping that maps all pairs of 3-D vectors x and -x onto the same tensor T. Uniformity implies that the mapping implicitly carries a definition of distance between 3-D planes (and lines) that is rotation invariant and monotone with the angle between the planes. Polar separability means that the norm of the representing tensor T is rotation invariant. One way to describe the mapping is that it maps a 3-D sphere into 6-D in such a way that the surface is uniformly stretched and all pairs of antipodal points map onto the same tensor. It has been demonstrated that the above mapping can be implemented by sampling the 3-D space using a specific class of symmetrically distributed quadrature filters.},

	abstract={Two different procedures for effecting a frequency analysis of a time-dependent signal locally in time are studied. The first procedure is the short-time or windowed Fourier transform; the second is the wavelet transform, in which high-frequency components are studied with sharper time resolution than low-frequency components. The similarities and the differences between these two methods are discussed. For both schemes a detailed study is made of the reconstruction method and its stability as a function of the chosen time-frequency density. Finally, the notion of time-frequency localization is made precise, within this framework, by two localization theorems.},

In this paper, we present a salient point detector that extract points where variations occur in the image, whether they are corner-like or not. The detector is based on wavelet transform to detect global variations as well as local ones. The wavelet-based salient points are evaluated for image retrieval with a retrieval system using texture features.

	abstract={This work addresses the design of a novel complex steerable wavelet construction, the generation of transform-space feature measurements associated with corner and edge presence and orientation properties, and the application of these measurements directly to image denoising. The decomposition uses pairs of bandpass filters that display symmetry and antisymmetry about a steerable axis of orientation. While the angular characterization of the bandpass filters is similar to those previously described, the radial characteristic is new, as is the manner of constructing the interpolation functions for steering. The complex filters have been engineered into a multirate system, providing a synthesis and analysis subband filtering system with good reconstruction properties. Although the performance of our proposed denoising strategy is currently below that of recently reported state-of-the-art techniques in denoising, it does compare favorably with wavelet coring approaches employing global thresholds and with an "Oracle" shrinkage technique, and presents a very promising avenue for exploring structure-based denoising in the wavelet domain. &copy; 2005 IEEE.},

	abstract={This paper addresses the problem of object detection and recognition in complex scenes, where objects are partially occluded. The approach presented herein is based on the hypothesis that a careful analysis of visible object details at various scales is critical for recognition in such settings. In general, however, computational complexity becomes prohibitive when trying to analyze multiple sub-parts of multiple objects in an image. To alleviate this problem, we propose a generative-model framework-namely, dynamic tree-structure belief networks (DTSBNs). This framework formulates object detection and recognition as inference of DTSBN structure and image-class conditional distributions, given an image. The causal (Markovian) dependencies in DTSBNs allow for design of computationally efficient inference, as well as for interpretation of the estimated structure as follows: each root represents a whole distinct object, while children nodes down the sub-tree represent parts of that object at various scales. Therefore, within the DTSBN framework, the treatment and recognition of object parts requires no additional training, but merely a particular interpretation of the tree/subtree structure. This property leads to a strategy for recognition of objects as a whole through recognition of their visible parts. Our experimental results demonstrate that this approach remarkably outperforms strategies without explicit analysis of object parts. [All rights reserved Elsevier]},

	abstract={This article proposes a generative image model, which is called "primal sketch," following Marr's insight and terminology. This model combines two prominent classes of generative models, namely, sparse coding model and Markov random field model, for representing geometric structures and stochastic textures, respectively. Specifically, the image lattice is divided into structure domain and texture domain. The sparse coding model is used to represent image intensities on the structure domain, where edge and ridge segments are modeled by image coding functions with explicit geometric and photometric parameters. The edge and ridge segments form a sketch graph whose nodes are corners and junctions. The sketch graph is governed by a simple spatial prior model. The Markov random field model is used to summarize image intensities on the texture domain, where the texture patterns are characterized by feature statistics in the form of marginal histograms of responses from a set of linear filters. The Markov random fields in-paint the texture domain while interpolating the structure domain seamlessly. A sketch pursuit algorithm is proposed for model fitting. A number of experiments on real images are shown to demonstrate the model and the algorithm. [All rights reserved Elsevier]},

First, we carry out the estimation of the affine or projective parameters related to the transformation involved in monocular region tracking. Second, we develop a monocular method to estimate 3D motion of an object in the visual space. In the latter, the six parameters of the rigid motion are estimated based on measurements of the six parameters of the affine transformation in the image. [All rights reserved Elsevier]},

	abstract={Tracking articulated structures like a hand or body within a reasonable time is challenging because of the high-dimensionality of the state space. Recently, a new optimization method, called `Stochastic Meta-Descent' (SMD) has been introduced in computer vision. This is a gradient descent scheme with adaptive and parameter-specific step sizes able to operate in a constrained space. However, while the local optimization works very well, reaching the global optimum is not guaranteed. We therefore propose an enhanced algorithm that wraps a particle filter around multiple SMD-based trackers, which play the role of many particles, i.e. that act as `smart particles'. After the standard particle propagation on the basis of a simple motion model, SMD is performed and the resulting new particle set is included such that the original Bayesian distribution is not altered. The resulting `Smart Particle Filter' (SPF) tracks high-dimensional articulated structures with far fewer samples than previous methods. Additionally, it can handle multiple hypotheses and clutter, where pure optimization approaches have problems. Good performance is demonstrated for the case of hand tracking from 3D range data.

We demonstrate the strength of the approach on a range of recognition tasks: From invariant single object recognition in clutter to multiclass categorization problems and complex scene understanding tasks that rely on the recognition of both shape-based as well as texture-based objects. Given the biological constraints that the system had to satisfy, the approach performs surprisingly well: It has the capability of learning from only a few training examples and competes with state-of-the-art systems. We also discuss the existence of a universal, redundant dictionary of features that could handle the recognition of most object categories. In addition to its relevance for computer vision, the success of this approach suggests a plausibility proof for a class of feedforward models of object recognition in cortex},

	abstract={As the fields of micro- and nano-technology mature, there will be an increased need to build tools that are able to work in these areas. Industry will require solutions for assembling and manipulating components, much as it has done in the macro range. With this need in mind, a new set of challenges requiring novel solutions have to be met. One of them is the ability to provide closed-loop feedback control for manipulators. We foresee that machine vision will play a leading role in this area. This paper introduces a technique for integrating machine vision into the field of micro-technology including two methods, one for tracking and one for depth reconstruction under an optical microscope.

	note={M1: Copyright 1998, IEE},
	abstract={This paper describes a new motion estimation algorithm that is potentially useful for both computer vision and video compression applications. It is hierarchical in structure, using a separable two-dimensional (2-D) discrete wavelet transform (DWT) on each frame to efficiently construct a multiresolution pyramid of subimages. The DWT is based on a complex-valued pair of four-tap FIR filters with Gabor-like characteristics. The resulting complex DWT (CDWT) effectively implements an analysis by an ensemble of Gabor-like filters with a variety of orientations and scales. The phase difference between the subband coefficients of each frame at a given subpel bears a predictable relation to a local translation in the region of the reference frame subtended by that subpel. That relation is used to estimate the displacement field at the coarsest scale of the multiresolution pyramid. Each estimate is accompanied by a directional confidence measure in the form of the parameters of a quadratic matching surface. The initial estimate field is progressively refined by a coarse-to fine strategy in which finer scale information is appropriately incorporated at each stage. The accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of the new algorithm are demonstrated in comparison testing against hierarchical implementations of intensity gradient-based and fractional-precision block matching motion estimators},

	abstract={This paper proposes a new algorithm for image restoration (deconvolution and denoising) which employs the recently developed dual-tree complex wavelet transform in an iterative Bayesian framework. Complex wavelets are selected for their key features: shift invariance, directional selectivity and efficiency. The aim is to find an optimal description of the restored image in the complex wavelet domain, which minimises a quadratic energy function of the wavelet coefficients. The algorithm searches for this minimum using an efficient conjugate gradient method. We show that this can improve the SNR performance of a good minimax deconvolution method, WaRD, which is used to initialise the iterations, by typically 1.2 dB. Convergence is quite rapid, achieving 80% of the ultimate performance gain in about 20 iterations. Each iteration takes around 5 seconds using MatLab on a 400 MHz Pentium computer with 256&times;256 pixel images},

	abstract={The goal in image segmentation is to label pixels in an image based on the properties of each pixel and its surrounding region. Recently content-based image retrieval (CBIR) has emerged as an application area in which retrieval is attempted by trying to gain unsupervised access to the image semantics directly rather than via manual annotation. To this end, we present an unsupervised segmentation technique in which colour and texture models are learned from the image prior to segmentation, and whose output (including the models) may subsequently be used as a content descriptor in a CBIR system. These models are obtained in a multiresolution setting in which hidden Markov trees (HMT) are used to model the key statistical properties exhibited by complex wavelet and scaling function coefficients. The unsupervised mean shift iteration (MSI) procedure is used to determine a number of image regions which are then used to train the models for each segmentation class},

We use an expectation-maximization algorithm to cluster large ILP coefficients that are spatially adjacent and similar in phase.

Coefficients of the ILP have complex values whose magnitudes indicate the amplitude of multilevel features, and whose phases indicate the nature of these features (e.g. ridges vs. edges). In particular, the phases of ILP coefficients are approximately invariant to small shifts in the original images. We accordingly introduce this transform as a solution to coarse scale template matching, where alignment concerns between decimation of a target and decimation of a larger search image can be mitigated, and computational efficiency can be maintained. Furthermore, template matching with ILP coefficients can provide several intuitive "near-matches" that may be of interest in image retrieval applications},

We show that projecting images in this new space provides a database browsing tool which is meaningful to the user.

We show that it is a well-suited basis for this problem as it is directionally selective, smoothly shift invariant, optimally decimated at coarse scales and invertible (no loss of information). Our detection scheme is fast because of the decimated nature of the DTCWT and yet provides accurate and robust keypoint localisation, thanks to the use of the "accumulated energy map". The regularity of this map is used to introduce a new mechanism for robust keypoint scale selection. Key-points of different nature and size can be detected with limited redundancy, in a way which is consistent with our visual perception. Furthermore results show better robustness against rotation compared to the SIFT detector},

The level of performance of their visual system and its robustness to image degradations still surpasses the best computer vision systems despite decades of engineering effort. In particular, the high accuracy of primates in ultra rapid object categorization and rapid serial visual presentation tasks is remarkable. Given the number of processing stages involved and typical neural latencies, such rapid visual processing is likely to be mostly feedforward. Here we show that a specific implementation of a class of feedforward theories of object recognition (that extend the Hubel and Wiesel simple-to-complex cell hierarchy and account for many anatomical and physiological constraints) can predict the level and the pattern of performance achieved by humans on a rapid masked animal vs. non-animal categorization task.},

	abstract={Traditional wavelet-based image processing algorithms and models have significant shortcomings in their treatment of edge contours. The standard modeling paradigm exploits the fact that wavelet coefficients representing smooth regions in images tend to be small; the multiscale nature of the wavelet transform implies that these small coefficients persist across scale. The edge contours in an image, however, cause ever larger wavelet coefficients as we move to finer resolutions. But if the contours are smooth, they become simple as we zoom in on them, and are well approximated by straight lines at fine scales. Standard wavelet models exploit the grayscale regularity of the smooth regions of the image, but not the geometric regularity of the contours. We build a model that accounts for this geometric regularity by capturing the dependencies between complex wavelet coefficients along a contour. The geometric hidden Markov tree (GHMT) assigns each wavelet coefficient (or spatial cluster of wavelet coefficients) a hidden state corresponding to a linear approximation of the local contour structure. The shift and rotational-invariance properties of the complex wavelet transform allow the GHMT to model the behavior of each coefficient given the presence of a linear edge at a specified orientation - the behavior of the wavelet coefficient given the state. By connecting the states together in a quadtree, the GHMT ties together wavelet coefficients along a contour, and also models how the contour itself behaves across scale. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the model by applying it to feature extraction},

	abstract={Since the Lucas-Kanade algorithm was proposed in 1981 image alignment has become one of the most widely used techniques in computer vision. Applications range from optical flow and tracking to layered motion, mosaic construction, and face coding. Numerous algorithms have been proposed and a wide variety of extensions have been made to the original formulation. We present an overview of image alignment, describing most of the algorithms and their extensions in a consistent framework. We concentrate on the inverse compositional algorithm, an efficient algorithm that we recently proposed. We examine which of the extensions to Lucas-Kanade can be used with the inverse compositional algorithm without any significant loss of efficiency, and which cannot. In this paper, part 1 in a series of papers, we cover the quantity approximated, the warp update rule, and the gradient descent approximation. In future papers, we will cover the choice of the error function, how to allow linear appearance variation, and how to impose priors on the parameters},

	abstract={We present a real-time algorithm which can recover the 3D trajectory of a monocular camera, moving rapidly through a previously unknown scene. Our system, which we dub MonoSLAM, is the first successful application of the SLAM methodology from mobile robotics to the "pure vision" domain of a single uncontrolled camera, achieving real time but drift-free performance inaccessible to Structure from Motion approaches. The core of the approach is the online creation of a sparse but persistent map of natural landmarks within a probabilistic framework. Our key novel contributions include an active approach to mapping and measurement, the use of a general motion model for smooth camera movement, and solutions for monocular feature initialization and feature orientation estimation. Together, these add up to an extremely efficient and robust algorithm which runs at 30 Hz with standard PC and camera hardware. This work extends the range of robotic systems in which SLAM can be usefully applied, but also opens up new areas. We present applications of MonoSLAM to real-time 3D localization and mapping for a high-performance full-size humanoid robot and live augmented reality with a hand-held camera. (C) 2007 IEEE.},

Automatic method is  preferred because it will greatly reduce the work involved. In the  paper, we present a feature based automatic mosaicing method based on  the related research on panorama reconstruction for photography. Scale  invariant feature transform (SIFT) is first applied to extract robust  features from the images, and by careful implementation of  Best-Bin-First (BBF) algorithm, we construct the global 0RW1S34RfeSDcfkexd09rT2k1RW1S34RfeSDcfkexd09rT2d-Tree from all the features  and search for the possible overlapping image pairs efficiently. Random  sample consensus (RANSAC) is chosen to further verify the matches. And  once the image pairs are all validated, minimum spanning tree (MST) is  used to obtain the best connected-component of the image set to recover  the transformation between images and project them into the mosaic  frame. Our experiment results show that the approach is robust to  background noises and illumination change in the images and can give  reliable and accurate results even for images of low overlapping or  with relatively few features.}

Many different descriptors have been proposed in the literature. It is unclear which descriptors are more appropriate and how their performance depends on the interest region detector. The descriptors should be distinctive and at the same time robust to changes in viewing conditions as well as to errors of the detector. Our evaluation uses as criterion recall with respect to precision and is carried out for different image transformations. We compare shape context [3], steerable filters [12], PCA-SIFT [19], differential invariants [20], spin images [21], SIFT [26], complex filters [37], moment invariants [43], and cross-correlation for different types of interest regions. We also propose an extension of the SIFT descriptor and show that it outperforms the original method. Furthermore, we observe that the ranking of the descriptors is mostly independent of the interest region detector and that the SIFT-based descriptors perform best. Moments and steerable filters show the best performance among the low dimensional descriptors. &copy; 2005 IEEE.},

We test detector-descriptor combinations on a database of 100 objects viewed from 144 calibrated viewpoints under three different lighting conditions. We find that the combination of Hessian-affine feature finder and SIFT features is most robust to viewpoint change. Harris-affine combined with SIFT and Hessian-affine combined with shape context descriptors were best respectively for lighting change and change in camera focal length.

	abstract={This paper presents a novel approach for detecting affine invariant interest points. Our method can deal with significant affine transformations including large scale changes. Such transformations introduce significant changes in the point location as well as in the scale and shape of the neighbourhood of an interest point. Our approach allows one to solve for these problems simultaneously. It is based on three key ideas: 1) the second moment matrix computed in a point can be used to normalize a region in an affine invariant way (skew and stretch); 2) the scale of the local structure is indicated by local extrema of normalized derivatives over scale; and 3) an affine-adapted Harris detector determines the location of interest points. A multi-scale version of this detector is used for initialization. An iterative algorithm then modifies location, scale and neighbourhood of each point and converges to affine invariant points. For matching and recognition, the image is characterized by a set of affine invariant points; the affine transformation associated with each point allows the computation of an affine invariant descriptor which is also invariant to affine illumination changes. A quantitative comparison of our detector with existing ones shows a significant improvement in the presence of large affine deformations. Experimental results for wide baseline matching show an excellent performance in the presence of large perspective transformations including significant scale changes. Results for recognition are very good for a database with more than 5000 images},

	abstract={In this paper we propose a novel approach for detecting interest points invariant to scale and affine transformations. Our scale and affine invariant detectors are based on the following recent results: (1) Interest points extracted with the Harris detector can be adapted to affine transformations and give repeatable results (geometrically stable). (2) The characteristic scale of a local structure is indicated by a local extremum over scale of normalized derivatives (the Laplacian). (3) The affine shape of a point neighborhood is estimated based on the second moment matrix. Our scale invariant detector computes a multi-scale representation for the Harris interest point detector and then selects points at which a local measure (the Laplacian) is maximal over scales. This provides a set of distinctive points which are invariant to scale, rotation and translation as well as robust to illumination changes and limited changes of viewpoint. The characteristic scale determines a scale invariant region for each point. We extend the scale invariant detector to affine invariance by estimating the affine shape of a point neighborhood. An iterative algorithm modifies location, scale and neighborhood of each point and converges to affine invariant points. This method can deal with significant affine transformations including large scale changes. The characteristic scale and the affine shape of neighborhood determine an affine invariant region for each point. We present a comparative evaluation of different detectors and show that our approach provides better results than existing methods. The performance of our detector is also confirmed by excellent matching results; the image is described by a set of scale/affine invariant descriptors computed on the regions associated with our points.},

While digital cameras can be used to capture whiteboard content, the images are usually taken from an angle, resulting in undesired perspective distortion. They may contain other distracting regions such as walls and shadows. The visual quality of those images is usually poor. This paper describes a system that automatically locates the boundary of a whiteboard, crops out the whiteboard region, rectifies it into a rectangle, and corrects the color to make the whiteboard completely white. In case a single image is not enough (e.g., large whiteboard and low-resolution camera), we have developed a robust feature-based technique to automatically stitch multiple overlapping images. The system has been tested extensively, and very good results have been obtained. [All rights reserved Elsevier]},

This approach works reasonably well because the dynamic language applications typically reside in separate address spaces from the services they use, accessing the services only through avenues that guarantee separation, including database drivers and network connections. Are dynamic languages like Ruby useful in middleware integration projects that require you to directly couple the dynamic code to legacy code?

Initial prototypes of the ESP were hosted on an Intel i486 CPU running a commercial real-time operating system (OS). The application, coded in C++, included a custom 'macro' language interpreter to direct biochemical analyses. To achieve greater flexibility and minimize the development effort for the 2nd generation of the ESP (2G ESP), MBARI replaced its 'macro' language with a general purpose, open-source scripting language, selecting Ruby for its unique combination of a succinct, English-like syntax with a seamless underlying object-oriented paradigm. The 2G ESP application, aside from custom servo control firmware, is coded entirely in Ruby, hosted on a low-power ARM9 CPU running Linux. Servo control was distributed onto a network of dedicated microcontrollers to cope with the nondeterministic delays inherent in the Linux operating system and Ruby interpreter. &copy; 2007 The Association for Laboratory Automation.},

	abstract={Scripting languages such as Python and Tcl are a powerful tool for the construction of flexible scientific software because they provide scientists with an interpreted problem solving environment and they provide a modular framework for controlling software components written in C, C++, and Fortran. However, a common problem faced by the developers of a scripted scientific application is that of integrating compiled code with an interpreter. To solve this problem, an extensible compiler, simplified wrapper and interface generator (SWIG), has been developed to automate the task of integrating compiled code with scripting language interpreters. SWIG requires no modifications to existing code and uses existing source to create bindings for nine different target languages including Python, Perl, Tcl, Ruby, Guile, and Java. By automating language integration, SWIG enables scientists to use scripting languages at all stages of software development and allows existing software to be more easily integrated into a scripting environment. Although SWIG has been in use for more than 6 years, little has been published on its design and the underlying mechanisms that make it work. Therefore, the primary goal of this paper is to cover these topics},

	note={\url{http://ai.stanford.edu/~diebel/attitude/attitude.pdf}},
	abstract={We present the three main mathematical constructs used to represent the attitude of a rigid body in three-dimensional space. These are (1) the rotation matrix, (2) a triple of Euler angles, and (3) the unit quaternion. To these we add a fourth, the rotation vector, which has many of the benefits of both Euler angles and quaternions, but neither the singularities of the former, nor the quadratic constraint of the latter. There are several other subsidiary representations, such as Cayley-Klein parameters and the axis-angle representation, whose relations to the three main representations are also described. Our exposition is catered to those who seek a thorough and unified reference on the whole subject; detailed derivations of some results are not presented.}

This article demonstrates that color histograms of multicolored objects provide a robust, efficient cue for indexing into a large database of models. It shows that color histograms are stable object representations in the presence of occlusion and over change in view, and that they can differentiate among a large number of objects. For solving the identification problem, it introduces a technique called Histogram Intersection which matches model and image histograms and a fast incremental version of Histogram Intersection, which allows real-time indexing into a large database of stored models.

This paper shows how the addition of an uncalibrated camera, aimed at the screen, solves both problems. Although the locations, orientations and optical parameters of the camera and projector are unknown, the projector-camera system calibrates itself by exploiting the homography between the projected slide and the camera image. Significant improvements are possible over passively calibrating systems since the projector actively manipulates the environment by placing feature points into the scene. For instance, using a low-resolution (160&times;120) camera, we can achieve an accuracy of &plusmn;3 pixels in a 1024&times;768 presentation slide.

	abstract={Motion estimation and compensation in wavelet domain have received much attention recently. To overcome the inefficiency of motion estimation in critically sampled wavelet domain, the low-band-shift (LBS) method and the complete-to-overcomplete discrete wavelet transform (CODWT) method are proposed for motion estimation in shift-invariant wavelet domain. However, a major disadvantage of these methods is the computational complexity. Although the CODWT method has reduced the computational complexity by skipping the inverse wavelet transform and making the direct link between the critically sampled subbands and the shift-invariant subbands, the full search algorithm (FSA) increases it. In this paper, we proposed two fast multiresolution motion estimation algorithms in shift-invariant wavelet domain: one is the wavelet matching error characteristic based partial distortion search (WMEC-PDS) algorithm, which improves computational efficiency of conventional partial distortion search algorithms while keeping the same estimate accuracy as the FSA; another is the anisotropic double cross search (ADCS) algorithm using multiresolution-spatio-temporal context, which provides a significantly computational load reduction while only introducing negligible distortion compared with the FSA. Due to the multiresolution nature, both the proposed approaches can be applied to wavelet-based scalable video coding. Experimental results show the superiority of the proposed fast motion estimation algorithms against other fast algorithms in terms of speed-up and quality. &copy; 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The model is computationally efficient (with linear-time computation and processing algorithms) and applicable to general Bayesian inference problems as a prior density for the data. In a simple estimation experiment, the complex wavelet HMT model outperforms a number of high-performance denoising algorithms, including redundant wavelet thresholding (cycle spinning) and the redundant HMT},

These models are unrealistic for many real-world signals. We develop a new framework for statistical signal processing based on wavelet-domain hidden Markov models (HMMs) that concisely models the statistical dependencies and non-Gaussian statistics encountered in real-world signals. Wavelet-domain HMMs are designed with the intrinsic properties of the wavelet transform in mind and provide powerful, yet tractable, probabilistic signal models. Efficient expectation maximization algorithms are developed for fitting the HMMs to observational signal data. The new framework is suitable for a wide range of applications, including signal estimation, detection, classification, prediction, and even synthesis. To demonstrate the utility of wavelet-domain HMMs, we develop novel algorithms for signal denoising, classification, and detection},

Based on tracked or matched features the relations between multiple views are computed. From this both the structure of the scene and the motion of the camera are retrieved. The ambiguity on the reconstruction is restricted from projective to metric through self-calibration. A flexible multi-view stereo matching scheme is used to obtain a dense estimation of the surface geometry. From the computed data different types of visual models are constructed. Besides the traditional geometry- and image-based approaches, a combined approach with view-dependent geometry and texture is presented.

	abstract={We cast the problem of motion segmentation of feature trajectories as linear manifold finding problems and propose a general framework for motion segmentation under affine projections which utilizes two properties of trajectory data: geometric constraint and locality. The geometric constraint states that the trajectories of the same motion lie in a low dimensional linear manifold and different motions result in different linear manifolds; locality, by which we mean in a transformed space a data and its neighbors tend to lie in the same linear manifold, provides a cue for efficient estimation of these manifolds. Our algorithm estimates a number of linear manifolds, whose dimensions are unknown beforehand, and segment the trajectories accordingly. It first transforms and normalizes the trajectories; secondly, for each trajectory it estimates a local linear manifold through local sampling; then it derives the affinity matrix based on principal subspace angles between these estimated linear manifolds; at last, spectral clustering is applied to the matrix and gives the segmentation result. Our algorithm is general without restriction on the number of linear manifolds and without prior knowledge of the dimensions of the linear manifolds. We demonstrate in our experiments that it can segment a wide range of motions including independent, articulated, rigid, non-rigid, degenerate, non-degenerate or any combination of them. In some highly challenging cases where other state-of-the-art motion segmentation algorithms may fail, our algorithm gives expected results. &copy; Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.},

We point out that the global motion subspace of an articulated object is a combination of a number of intersecting rigid motion subspaces of the parts. Depending on whether a link of two parts is a joint or an axis, the global motion subspace loses one or two in rank for each link. The rank loss results from the intersection between the rigid motion subspaces of linked parts. Furthermore, the intersection is, in fact, the motion subspace of the link. From these observations, we describe the rank constraint of the global motion subspace of an articulated object; we give an algorithm to recover the image motion of a link, either a joint or an axix; and we propose a novel but simple approach, which is based on subspace clustering, to recover articulated shape and motion from a single-view image sequence.},

	abstract={Cell biology applications, protocols in immunology and stem cell research, require that individual cells are handled under strict control of their contacts to other cells or synthetic surfaces. Dielectrophoresis (DEP) in microfluidic chips is an established technique to investigate, group, wash, cultivate and sort cells contact-free under physiological conditions: microelectrode octode cages, versatile dielectrophoretic elements energized with radio frequency electric fields, stably trap single cells or cellular aggregates. For medical applications and cell cultivation, possible side effects of the dielectrophoretic manipulation, such as membrane polarization and Joule heating, have to be quantified. Therefore, we characterized the electric field-induced warming in dielectrophoretic cages using ohmic resistance measurements, fluorometry, liquid crystal beads, infra-red thermography and bubble size thermometry. We compare the results of these techniques with respect to the influences of voltage, electric conductivity of buffer, frequency, cage size and electrode surface. We conclude that in the culture medium thermal effects may be neglected if low voltages and an electric field-reducing phase pattern are used. Our experimental results provide explicit values for estimating the thermal effect on dielectrophoretically caged cells and show that Joule heating is best minimized by optimizing the cage geometry and reducing the buffer conductivity. The results may additionally serve to evaluate and improve theoretical predictions on field-induced effects. Based on present-day chip processing possibilities, DEP is well suited for the manipulation of cells},

	abstract={This paper introduces the double-density dual-tree discrete wavelet transform (DWT), which is a DWT that combines the double-density DWT and the dual-tree DWT, each of which has its own characteristics and advantages. The transform corresponds to a new family of dyadic wavelet tight frames based on two scaling functions and four distinct wavelets. One pair of the four wavelets are designed to be offset from the other pair of wavelets so that the integer translates of one wavelet pair fall midway between the integer translates of the other pair. Simultaneously, one pair of wavelets are designed to be approximate Hilbert transforms of the other pair of wavelets so that two complex (approximately analytic) wavelets can be formed. Therefore, they can be used to implement complex and directional wavelet transforms. The paper develops a design procedure to obtain finite impulse response (FIR) filters that satisfy the numerous constraints imposed. This design procedure employs a fractional-delay allpass filter, spectral factorization, and filterbank completion. The solutions have vanishing moments, compact support, a high degree of smoothness, and are nearly shift-invariant},

	abstract={This paper describes a new set of dyadic wavelet frames with two generators. The construction is simple, yet the wavelets cover the time-frequency plane in an arrangement that provides a higher sampling in both time and frequency. Specifically, the spectrum of the first wavelet is concentrated halfway between the spectrum of the second wavelet and the spectrum of its dilated version. In addition, the second wavelet is translated by half integers rather than whole integers in the frame construction. This arrangement leads to an expansive wavelet transform that is approximately shift invariant and has intermediate scales.

	abstract={Innovation is rapidly becoming democratized. Users, aided by  improvements in computer and communications technology, increasingly  can develop their own new products and services. These innovating users  -- both individuals and firms -- often freely share their innovations  with others, creating user-innovation communities and a rich  intellectual commons. In Democratizing Innovation,  Eric von Hippel looks closely at this emerging system of user-centered  innovation. He explains why and when users find it profitable to  develop new products and services for themselves, and why it often pays  users to reveal their innovations freely for the use of all.
The trend toward democratized innovation can be seen  in software and information products -- most notably in the free and  open-source software movement -- but also in physical products. Von  Hippel's many examples of user innovation in action range from surgical  equipment to surfboards to software security features. He shows that  product and service development is concentrated among "lead users," who  are ahead on marketplace trends and whose innovations are often  commercially attractive.
Von Hippel argues  that manufacturers should redesign their innovation processes and that  they should systematically seek out innovations developed by users. He  points to businesses -- the custom semiconductor industry is one  example -- that have learned to assist user-innovators by providing  them with toolkits for developing new products. User innovation has a  positive impact on social welfare, and von Hippel proposes that  government policies, including R&D subsidies and tax credits,  should be realigned to eliminate biases against it. The goal of a  democratized user-centered innovation system, says von Hippel, is well  worth striving for. An electronic version of this book is available  under a Creative Commons license.}

	abstract={A key component of a mobile robot system is the ability to localize itself accurately and, simultaneously, to build a map of the environment. Most of the existing algorithms are based on laser range finders, sonar sensors or artificial landmarks. In this paper, we describe a vision-based mobile robot localization and mapping algorithm, which uses scale-invariant image features as natural landmarks in unmodified environments. The invariance of these features to image translation, scaling and rotation makes them suitable landmarks for mobile robot localization and map building. With our Triclops stereo vision system, these landmarks are localized and robot ego-motion is estimated by least-squares minimization of the matched landmarks. Feature viewpoint variation and occlusion are taken into account by maintaining a view direction for each landmark. Experiments show that these visual landmarks are robustly matched, robot pose is estimated and a consistent three-dimensional map is built. As image features are not noise-free, we carry out error analysis for the landmark positions and the robot pose. We use Kalman filters to track these landmarks in a dynamic environment, resulting in a database map with landmark positional uncertainty.},

	note={M1: Copyright 1995, IEE},
	abstract={A new method named STM is described for determining distance of objects and rapid STM uses image defocus information and is based on a new spatial-domain convolution/deconvolution transform. The method requires only two images taken with different camera parameters such as lens position, focal length, and aperture diameter. Both images can be arbitrarily blurred and neither of them needs to be a focused image. Therefore STM is very fast in comparison with depth-from-focus methods which search for the lens position or focal length of best focus. The method involves simple local operations and can be easily implemented in parallel to obtain the depth-map of a scene. STM has been implemented on an actual camera system named SPARCS. Experiments on the performance of STM and their results on real-world planar objects are presented. The results indicate that the accuracy of STM compares well with depth-from-focus methods and is useful in practical applications. The utility of the method is demonstrated for rapid autofocusing of electronic cameras},

In particular, we demonstrate the necessity of subgroups of the parameter set by showing examples of texture synthesis that fail when those parameters are removed from the set.

	abstract={We describe a method for removing noise from digital images, based on a statistical model of the coefficients of an overcomplete multiscale oriented basis. Neighborhoods of coefficients at adjacent positions and scales are modeled as the product of two independent random variables: a Gaussian vector and a hidden positive scalar multiplier. The latter modulates the local variance of the coefficients in the neighborhood, and is thus able to account for the empirically observed correlation between the coefficient amplitudes. Under this model, the Bayesian least squares estimate of each coefficient reduces to a weighted average of the local linear estimates over all possible values of the hidden multiplier variable. We demonstrate through simulations with images contaminated by additive white Gaussian noise that the performance of this method substantially surpasses that of previously published methods, both visually and in terms of mean squared error},

	abstract={A fast circle detection method using a variant of Hough-like technique is reported. The proposed technique is simple in implementation, efficient in computation and robust to noise. In general, to evaluate circle parameters for all possible point triplets in an edge image containing n points, nC3 enumerations of the points have to be examined. However, if specific relations of the circle points are sought, the required number of enumerations can be reduced. The authors propose one such scheme of detection with point triplets possessing right angle property and the required enumerations can be reduced to nC2. Moreover, a novel processing strategy known as hypothesis filtering is introduced. The strategy includes two hypothesis constraints termed consistency checking with gradient angles and neighbouring points validation. Experimental results are demonstrated to reveal the performance of the method in detecting circles in both synthetic and real images. Since the proposed method adopts a right angle criterion for hypothesis, circles occluded or broken by more than one half may not be detected. Test results show that the limitation of the proposed method appears to be acceptable. When compared with established Hough transform techniques, the main strengths of the proposed detection method are its attractively computational and memory complexities and good accuracy of detection},

	abstract={Robust vision-based grasping is still a hard problem for humanoid robot systems. When being restricted to using the camera system built-in into the robot's head for object localization, the scenarios get often very simplified in order to allow the robot to grasp autonomously. Within the computer vision community, many object recognition and localization systems exist, but in general, they are not tailored to the application on a humanoid robot. In particular, accurate 6D object localization in the camera coordinate system with respect to a 3D rigid model is crucial for a general framework for grasping. While many approaches try to avoid the use of stereo calibration, we will present a system that makes explicit use of the stereo camera system in order to achieve maximum depth accuracy. Our system can deal with textured objects as well as objects that can be segmented globally and are defined by their shape. Thus, it covers the cases of objects with complex texture and complex shape. Our work is directly linked to a grasping framework being implemented on the humanoid robot ARM AR and serves as its perception module for various grasping and manipulation experiments in a kitchen scenario.},

A large number K of labels arises of which many are equivalent, so the equivalence must be resolved.

	abstract={In this paper, a complete theory of steerable filters is presented which shows that quadrature filters are only a special case of steerable filters. Although there have been a large number of approaches dealing with the theory of steerable filters, none of these gives a complete theory with respect to the transformation groups which deform the filter kernel. Michaelis and Sommer (1995) and Hel-Or and Teo (1996; 1998) were the first ones who gave a theoretical justification for steerability based on Lie group theory. But the approach of Michaelis and Sommer considers only Abelian Lie groups. Although the approach of Hel-Or and Teo considers all Lie groups, their method for generating the basis functions may fail as shown in this paper. We extend these steerable approaches to arbitrary Lie groups, like the important case of the rotation group SO(3) in three dimensions. Quadrature filters serve for computing the local energy and local phase of a signal. Whereas for the one dimensional case quadrature filters are theoretically well founded, this is not the case for higher dimensional signal spaces. The monogenic signal (Felsberg and Sommer, 2001) based on the Riesz transformation has been shown to be a rotational invariant generalization of the analytic signal. A further generalization of the monogenic signal, the 2D rotational invariant quadrature filter (Kothe, 2003), has been shown to capture richer structures in images as the monogenic signal. We present a generalization of the rotational invariant quadrature filter based on our steerable theory. Our approach includes the important case of 3D rotational invariant quadrature filters but it is not limited to any signal dimension and includes all transformation groups that own a unitary group representation},

	abstract={Early vision algorithms often have a first stage of linear-filtering that `extracts' from the image information at multiple scales of resolution and multiple orientations. A common difficulty in the design and implementation of such schemes is that one feels compelled to discretize coarsely the space of scales and orientations in order to reduce computation and storage costs. A technique is presented that allows: 1) computing the best approximation of a given family using linear combinations of a small number of `basis' functions; and 2) describing all finite-dimensional families, i.e., the families of filters for which a finite dimensional representation is possible with no error. The technique is based on singular value decomposition and may be applied to generating filters in arbitrary dimensions and subject to arbitrary deformations. The relevant functional analysis results are reviewed and precise conditions for the decomposition to be feasible are stated. Experimental results are presented that demonstrate the applicability of the technique to generating multiorientation multi-scale 2D edge-detection kernels. The implementation issues are also discussed},

	abstract={Where feature points are used in real-time frame-rate applications, a high-speed feature detector is necessary. Feature detectors such as SIFT (DoG), Harris and SUSAN are good methods which yield high quality features, however they are too computationally intensive for use in real-time applications of any complexity. Here we show that machine learning can be used to derive a feature detector which can fully process live PAL video using less than 7% of the available processing time. By comparison neither the Harris detector (120%) nor the detection stage of SIFT (300%) can operate at full frame rate. Clearly a high-speed detector is of limited use if the features produced are unsuitable for downstream processing. In particular, the same scene viewed from two different positions should yield features which correspond to the same real-world 3D locations. Hence the second contribution of this paper is a comparison corner detectors based on this criterion applied to 3D scenes. This comparison supports a number of claims made elsewhere concerning existing corner detectors. Further, contrary to our initial expectations, we show that despite being principally constructed for speed, our detector significantly outperforms existing feature detectors according to this criterion},

	abstract={A requirement of a visual measurement device is that both measurements and their uncertainties can be determined. This paper develops an uncertainty analysis which includes both the errors in image localization and the uncertainty in the imaging transformation. The matrix representing the imaging transformation is estimated from image-to-world point correspondences. A general expression is derived for the covariance of this matrix. This expression is valid if the matrix is over determined and also if the minimum number of correspondences are used. A bound on the errors of the first order approximations involved is also derived. Armed with this covariance result the uncertainty of any measurement can be predicted, and furthermore the distribution of correspondences can be chosen to achieve a particular bound on the uncertainty. Examples are given of measurements such as distance and parallelism for several applications. These include indoor scenes and architectural measurements},

We used a K-mean plus Nearest Neighbor classifier to validate our approach, mostly because it was simple to implement. It has proved effective but still too slow for real-time use. In this paper, we advocate instead the use of randomized trees as the classification technique. It is both fast enough for real-time performance and more robust. It also gives us a principled way not only to match keypoints but to select during a training phase those that are the most recognizable ones. This results in a real-time system able to detect and position in 3D planar, non-planar, and even deformable objects. It is robust to illuminations changes, scale changes and occlusions},

	abstract={Automatic registration of range images is a fundamental problem in 3D modeling of free-form objects. Various feature matching algorithms have been proposed for this purpose. However, these algorithms suffer from various limitations mainly related to their applicability, efficiency, robustness to resolution, and the discriminating capability of the used feature representation. We present a novel feature matching algorithm for automatic pairwise registration of range images which overcomes these limitations. Our algorithm uses a novel tensor representation which represents semi-local 3D surface patches of a range image by third order tensors. Multiple tensors are used to represent each range image. Tensors of two range images are matched to identify correspondences between them. Correspondences are verified and then used for pairwise registration of the range images. Experimental results show that our algorithm is accurate and efficient. Moreover, it is robust to the resolution of the range images, the number of tensors per view, the required amount of overlap, and noise. Comparisons with the spin image representation revealed that our representation has more discriminating capabilities and performs better at a low resolution of the range images},

	abstract={A crucial problem that involves feature-based image registration algorithms is how to reliably establish the correspondence between the features detected in the sensed image and those detected in the reference image. Generally, most existing methods only use spatial relations or feature similarity, or a simple combination of them, to solve this problem, and all have some limitations. In this paper, a new feature-matching strategy is developed. It is realized by introducing a function whose independent variable is the match matrix, which describes the correspondence of the features, to combine spatial relations and organically feature similarity, and its global maximum is assumed to be reached if the sensed image is completely aligned with the reference image. Thus, the feature correspondence can be estimated by finding the maximum of the function. Two approaches are devised to solve the optimization problem. One is based on the branch-and-bound strategy to yield a global optimal solution, and the other uses an iterative algorithm that combines graduated assignment and variable metric methods to search for a local optimal solution with low computational complexity. The proposed method can work without the limitations of feature type, similarity criterion, and transform model, and its performance is evaluated using a variety of real images. Compared with some existing methods, it is fast and robust, and has the highest accuracy.},

When model databases are large, the use of high-dimensional features is critical, due to the improved level of discrimination they can provide. Unfortunately, finding the nearest neighbour to a query point rapidly becomes inefficient as the dimensionality of the feature space increases. Past indexing methods have used hash tables for hypothesis recovery, but only in low-dimensional situations. In this paper we show that a new variant of the k-d tree search algorithm makes indexing in higher-dimensional spaces practical. This Best Bin First, or BBF search is an approximate algorithm which finds the nearest neighbour for a large fraction of the queries, and a very close neighbour in the remaining cases. The technique has been integrated into a fully developed recognition system, which is able to detect complex objects in real, cluttered scenes in just a few seconds},

Computer vision algorithms that are intended to form part of a perceptual user interface must be fast and efficient.

The mean shift algorithm robustly finds the mode (peak) of probability distributions. We first describe histogram based methods of producing object probability distributions. In our case, we want to track the mode of an object's probability distribution within a video scene. Since the probability distribution of the object can change and move dynamically in time, the mean shift algorithm is modified to deal with dynamically changing probability distributions. The modified algorithm is called the Continuously Adaptive Mean Shift (CAMSHIFT) algorithm. CAMSHIFT is then used as an interface for games and graphics},

It then demonstrates how this plane identification method can be used as a first step in an image analysis process, when point matching between images is unreliable.

Efficacy of sampling over time is demonstrated with visual tracking. More pervasive noise distributions, as commonly arise in visual background clutter, demand a more powerful, non-Gaussian approach. One very effective approach is to use random sampling. The CONDENSATION algorithm, described here, combines random sampling with learned dynamical models to propagate an entire probability distribution for object position and shape, over time. The result is accurate tracking of agile motion in clutter, decidedly more robust than what has previously been attainable by Kalman Altering. Despite the use of random sampling, the algorithm is efficient, running in near real-time when applied to visual tracking},

These methods allow the libraries to combine the seemingly contradictory qualities of ease of use and uncompromising efficiency. However, libraries that use these methods are notoriously difficult to develop. This article examines the benefits reaped and the difficulties encountered in using these methods to create a friendly, high performance, tensor library. We find that template methods mostly deliver on this promise, though requiring moderate compromises in usability and efficiency},

	abstract={Dynamically typed scripting languages have become popular in recent years. Although interpreted languages allow for substantial reduction of software development time, they are often rejected due to performance concerns. In this paper we present an extension for the programming language Ruby, called HornetsEye, which facilitates the development of real-time machine vision algorithms within Ruby. Apart from providing integration of crucial libraries for input and output, HornetsEye provides fast native implementations (compiled code) for a generic set of array operators. Different array operators were compared with equivalent implementations in C++. Not only was it possible to achieve comparable real-time performance, but also to exceed the efficiency of the C++ implementation in several cases. Implementations of several algorithms were given to demonstrate how the array operators can be used to create concise implementations.},

	abstract={Geometric reconstruction of the environment from images is critical in autonomous mapping and robot navigation. Geometric reconstruction involves feature tracking, i.e., locating corresponding image features in consecutive images, and structure from motion (SFM), i.e., recovering the 3D structure of the environment from a set of correspondences between images. Although algorithms for feature tracking and structure from motion are well-established, their use in practical mobile robot applications is still difficult because of occluded features, non-smooth motion between frames, and ambiguous patterns in images. We show how a sampling-based representation can be used in place of the traditional Gaussian representation of uncertainty. We show how sampling can be used for both feature tracking and SFM and we show how they are combined in this framework. The approach is exercised in the context of a mobile robot navigating through an outdoor environment with an omnidirectional camera},

	abstract={Ego-motion estimation for an agile single camera moving through general, unknown scenes becomes a much more challenging problem when real-time performance is required rather than under the off-line processing conditions under which most successful structure from motion work has been achieved. This task of estimating camera motion from measurements of a continuously expanding set of self-mapped visual features is one of a class of problems known as Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) in the robotics community, and we argue that such real-time mapping research, despite rarely being camera-based, is more relevant here than off-line structure from motion methods due to the more fundamental emphasis placed on propagation of uncertainty. We present a top-down Bayesian framework for single-camera localisation via mapping of a sparse set of natural features using motion modelling and an information-guided active measurement strategy, in particular addressing the difficult issue of real-time feature initialisation via a factored sampling approach. Real-time handling of uncertainty permits robust localisation via the creating and active measurement of a sparse map of landmarks such that regions can be re-visited after periods of neglect and localisation can continue through periods when few features are visible. Results are presented of real-time localisation for a hand-waved camera with very sparse prior scene knowledge and all processing carried out on a desktop PC},

	abstract={A texture descriptor invariant to translation, rotation and scale changes is presented in this paper. A power spectral image is obtained by using DFT transformation to extract the proposed descriptor for the translation invariance of a given texture. The power spectral image is scale-normalized by a cut-off frequency on the power spectral image that is calculated as the total energy inside a circle with its radius of the cut-off frequency amounts to a predetermined value. Finally, the rotation invariant Zernike moments are calculated on the translation and scale normalized image for a rotation, scale and translation invariant descriptor. The extraction is simple and fast, using fast known DFT and Zernike transformation. The matching is also simple and fast using the Euclidean distance measure between a query and test textures. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is shown with various texture databases.},

	abstract={The paper tackles the problem of feature points matching between pair of images of the same scene. This is a key problem in computer vision. The method we discuss here is a version of the SVD-matching proposed by Scott and Longuet-Higgins and later modified by Pilu, that we elaborate in order to cope with large scale variations. To this end we add to the feature detection phase a keypoint descriptor that is robust to large scale and view-point changes. Furthermore, we include this descriptor in the equations of the proximity matrix that is central to the SVD-matching. At the same time we remove from the proximity matrix all the information about the point locations in the image, that is the source of mismatches when the amount of scene variation increases. The main contribution of this work is in showing that this compact and easy algorithm can be used for severe scene variations. We present experimental evidence of the improved performance with respect to the previous versions of the algorithm. &copy; 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract={This paper presents a simple and effective method for matching two uncalibrated images. Corner points are firstly extracted as interest points in the two images. Each interest point is assigned one dominant orientation. The initial set of point matches is then obtained by singular value decomposition of a correspondence strength matrix. A new expression of this matrix is introduced to handle more complicated imaging conditions. Each element of this matrix is the similarity measure between two interest points. The new similarity measure is invariant to image rotation by taking into account the dominant orientation of the two interest points. The epipolar geometry constraint is finally imposed to reject the false matches. Experimental results on real images show this approach to be effective for general image matching},

	abstract={This paper presents a new simple method for achieving feature correspondence across a pair of images which requires no calibration information and draws from the method proposed by Scott and Longuet Higgins [8]. Despite the well-known combinatorial complexity of the problem, this work shows that an acceptably good solution can be obtained directly by singular value decomposition of an appropriate image-based correspondence strength matrix. The paper includes several experiments and discusses the method and draws comparisons with a related relaxation-based method by [14]. Given its tremendous performance/complexity figure, the method is particularly suitable for research purposes where an off the shelf but reliable feature correspondence is needed. For this reason, a succinct MATLAB implementation of the method is included and a C version will be soon available on the WEB.},

	abstract={This paper has two goals. The first is to develop a variety of robust methods for the computation of the fundamental matrix, the calibration-free representation of camera motion. The methods are drawn from the principal categories of robust estimators, viz. case deletion diagnostics, M-estimators and random sampling, and the paper develops the theory required to apply them to nonlinear orthogonal regression problems. Although a considerable amount of interest has focused on the application of robust estimation in computer vision, the relative merits of the many individual methods are unknown. The second goal is therefore to compare and judge the methods. Comparative tests are carried out using correspondences generated both synthetically in a statistically controlled fashion and from feature matching in real imagery. In contrast with previously reported methods, the goodness of fit to the synthetic observations is judged not in terms of the fit to the observations per se but in terms of fit to the ground truth. A variety of error measures are examined. The experiments allow a statistically satisfying and quasi-optimal method to be synthesized, which is shown to be stable with up to 50\% outlier contamination, and may still be used if there are more than 50\% outliers. Performance bounds are established for the method, and a variety of robust methods to estimate the standard deviation of the error and covariance matrix of the parameters are examined. The results of the comparison have broad applicability to vision algorithms where the input data are corrupted not only by noise but also by gross outliers},

	abstract={Natural images are the composite consequence of multiple factors related to scene structure, illumination, and imaging. Multilinear algebra, the algebra of higher-order tensors, offers a potent mathematical framework for analyzing the multifactor structure of image ensembles and for addressing the difficult problem of disentangling the constituent factors or modes. Our multilinear modeling technique employs a tensor extension of the conventional matrix singular value decomposition (SVD), known as the N-mode SVD. As a concrete example, we consider the multilinear analysis of ensembles of facial images that combine several modes, including different facial geometries (people), expressions, head poses, and lighting conditions. Our resulting "TensorFaces" representation has several advantages over conventional eigenfaces. More generally, multilinear analysis shows promise as a unifying framework for a variety of computer vision problems},

	abstract={The use of wavelets in the image processing domain is still in its infancy, and largely associated with image compression. With the advent of the dual-tree hypercomplex wavelet transform (D-HWT) and its improved shift invariance and directional selectivity, applications in other areas of image processing are more conceivable. This paper discusses the problems and solutions in developing the DHWT and its inverse. It also offers a practical implementation of the algorithms involved. The aim of this work is to apply the DHWT in machine vision. Tentative work on a possible new way of feature extraction is presented. The paper shows that 2-D hypercomplex basis wavelets can be used to generate steerable filters which allow rotation as well as translation.},
